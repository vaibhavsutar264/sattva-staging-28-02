                Yoga is the spiritual heritage of humanity born in the silence
                of the great Himalayas. From the Himalayas, these teachings came

                and from there they have spread throughout the world. These
                teachings belong to each and every one of us. We are living in a
                time when the evolution of consciousness is of paramount
                importance.

                  <h4>Integrative Practices</h4>
                  <p>
                    For Sattva students, there is nothing that is not yoga. That
                    is why Sattva Yoga has such an integrative, holistic
                    approach. It is fresh, alive, and ever-evolving. It has been
                    designed as an integrative approach, meaning it guides your
                    journey both on and off the mat. Sattva Yoga genuinely
                    impacts all aspects of your life and delivers the full and
                    radical value of yoga in its true, evolutionary manner.{' '}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sattva in Sanskrit means whole. The practice of yoga is
                    actually intended to be whole as well. It is not reduced to
                    just a sequence of yoga asanas that are just one small
                    aspect of yoga. The yogis of the Himalayas practiced the
                    whole yogic science so they could access higher states of
                    consciousness as well as higher physical abilities.{' '}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The path of Sattva Yoga is integrative because it is one of
                    the most comprehensive approaches to yoga in the world
                    today. With its roots in the timeless Vedic and Tantric
                    traditions, Sattva Yoga was developed in the Himalayas after
                    years of study and research. It incorporates and transcends
                    all branches of yoga, bringing together the entirety of
                    essential practices and ancient yogic teachings,
                    contemporary science and mind-body research in a radically
                    holistic and powerfully evolutionary way to create a clear
                    path for the individual to experience a full, healthy,
                    abundant, and joyous life. It is an integral lineage
                    experience that is an ever-evolving and inclusive practice
                    of meditation, kriya, asana, movement, pranayama, radical
                    aliveness, and timeless wisdom. Coming together like this, a
                    new layer of intelligence is occurring as Sattva Yoga
                    engages us in new ways of being.

                  <h4>Sattva Yoga</h4>
                  <p>
                    The Sattva Yoga path offers unique and potent practices. It
                    embraces transformational meditation and Tantric kriyas
                    which work with the subtle electricity of the body. It
                    incorporates Vinyasa flows that channel the movement of
                    energy, Himalayan Kundalini practices to awaken the power
                    within, and pranayama to cultivate the breath and nourish
                    the body with vitality. Sattva Yoga balances the divine
                    feminine and the sacred masculine through chi and laya
                    movements and uses mantra sound work to expand energy
                    fields, radically shift the mind, and break down barriers.
                    It also encourages partner work to connect us with our
                    highest Self through the others. The practice of Sattva Yoga
                    cultivates the experience of non-duality, where both
                    stillness and movement exist at the same time. Sattva Yoga
                    is freedom, movement, depth, stillness, transcendence, joy,
                    compassion, grace, and truth. The practice is a powerfully
                    transformative experience that awakens the Self and leads
                    you to your full potential so you may illuminate yourself
                    and spread your light.

                    With tools and techniques to address and transform all five
                    koshas (layers) of the human body, each yoga journey brings
                    about a subtle cellular shift, a dynamic mind-body
                    experience, as well as a mindful meditative experience. The
                    practices increase strength, build vitality, and create
                    mental clarity. They help raise our consciousness and enable
                    us to live a life full of joy and possibility. The Sattva
                    Yoga practice meets you where you are now. From the beginner
                    to a seasoned practitioner, it provides a complete and
                    powerful pathway to self-mastery and a radically alive life.

              <h4>Sattva Practices</h4>
              <p>
                A Sattva yogi is committed to the path, a sincere practitioner.
                On that path, individuals live life as a practice. A Sattva yogi
                is always a student, even as a teacher.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sattva yogis care deeply about coming together to have a
                community of truth and a sense of sacred relationship within
                that community. When we tap into each otherâ€™s capacity to
                evolve, the community can be stronger than the individuals.
                Sattva Yoga is a way of living by example. Community goes beyond
                just the humans living on this planet to the environment and
                welfare of all creatures. We behave in a manner that supports
                and aligns with nature and have a sense of responsibility and a
                deep compassion for our planet and all beings.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sattva practices are based on the ancient knowledge that where
                our attention goes, energy flows. As a result, Sattva practices
                focus on regular, conscious rituals that allow us to cultivate
                our connection to Self, to unity consciousness, devotion, and
                receptivity. In the absence of conscious rituals, unconscious
                rituals start to dominate our life and foster a mundane,
                unawakened experience of living.
