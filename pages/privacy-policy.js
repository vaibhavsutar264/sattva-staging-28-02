                C. How Do We Keep Your Personal Information Secure?

              <p className="revamp-para-small">
                We use appropriate technical and organizational security
                measures to protect any Personal Information we process against
                unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

              <p className="revamp-para-small">
                Unfortunately, nobody is truly and completely safe from hackers.
                Although we do our best to protect your Personal Information, we
                cannot guarantee security, no Internet transmission can ever be
                guaranteed 100% secure, and so we encourage you to take care
                when disclosing Personal Information online and to use readily
                available tools, such as Internet firewalls, secure e-mail and
                similar technologies to protect yourself online.
