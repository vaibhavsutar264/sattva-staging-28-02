                  Whatever world we live in, we create myths and symbols around
                  it. We give meaning to things they don’t have. And it takes
                  great courage to even pay attention to it, to step out of the
                  bubble.{' '}

                <p>
                  We’ll jump right into the course, just as the motorcycle
                  riders were plopped right into this new world of Rishikesh
                  India, the crazy Indian road killer traffic, a radical modern
                  guru, and the unexpected news that cloudbursts and monsoons
                  have lasted a month longer than usual, washing away villages,
                  bridges, and reeking havoc on the road to the first of four
                  sacred Himalayan peaks of freedom. Every pilgrimage has to
                  have its challenges. Every pilgrimage requires us to make
                  great leaps, because a pilgrimage is a journey to truth. And
                  the truth cannot be contained in our small worldview. So, we
                  must leap out of that worldview to find truth, but thankfully
                  the truth will set us free.{' '}
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>
                    In this chapter, we learn how important it is to take
                    quantum leaps in our own life.
                  </strong>{' '}
                  If we want freedom, we must break this bubble we live in. This
                  bubble can be explained as our habitual, unexamined, and
                  unquestioned worldview; how we see/perceive the world. And
                  this bubble can enslave us, especially if we think we are free
                  when we are not. So the first step in a journey to freedom is
                  to step out of the bubble. This takes great courage, great
                  willingness and nothing less than total commitment, and the
                  reward is nothing less than liberation and freedom.

                <h5 class='chapter-heading'>HOW THESE CHAPTERS FLOW </h5>
                <p>
                  First, you’ll watch the episode, knowing what the general
                  topic of the chapter is, and you’ll see the lesson on freedom
                  jump out at you. Then you’ll read the Chapter where we explore
                  the wisdom of freedom in real down-to-earth language and
                  detail. Then we break the wisdom down into bullet points for
                  your easy reference. Next we explore how the characters in the
                  show embody that wisdom by showing you video clips and
                  discussing the virtues/character strengths they exhibit. By
                  watching and relating to them, you can cultivate these virtues
                  for your own freedom.{' '}
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lastly we finish off by taking you deep into the journey in
                  the Himalayas again, with the unseen bonus footage filmed
                  during The Road To Dharma. These deep discussions are with
                  master yogi Anand Mehrotra. As you can imagine, only pieces
                  can make it into a show, but now you get to see the whole
                  thing, as if you were right there on a journey. And then
                  finally we’ll leave you with an audio meditation practice that
                  combines pranayama, kriya, and mantra. The goal of these
                  powerful yet compact practices is for you to feel and shift
                  your energy to embody this aspect of freedom, and do realize
                  you can do so in a matter of 20-30 minutes.{' '}
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now, I am a realist and I realize that you might just binge
                  watch the whole series at once and then come back and read the
                  chapters. That’s fine. Get into it. Take the journey. Then,
                  when you come back and read a chapter, watch the episode
                  again. You’ll experience the episode in a very different
                  manner. The teaching will deepen. And the power of watching a
                  real journey is that you feel emotions, the mind actually has
                  neurons firing like you are there, you empathize, and you
                  receive the experience. And so, if you are watching with the
                  wisdom in mind, then you are translating the experience into
                  deep understanding even quicker. And then one day, perhaps you
                  can see your life as objectively as a movie that you are here
                  to learn through… but we’ll talk about that later… or maybe
                  you’re ready now, ready to take that huge leap and let go of
                  identifying with your story! That’s a great start and intro
                  into Quantum Leaps.

                  I like to begin each chapter with a personal example and story
                  that is not in the Road To Dharma series. I like to share
                  something of my life that you can relate to and we can
                  reference when discussing some quite profound and often
                  daunting wisdom. So I’ll start with a story about how all this
                  motorcycling with a guru began. It was by all means a quantum
                  leap for me, doing something that seemed impossible and would
                  possibly kill me.{' '}

                  <strong>
                    I had come to see Anand Mehrotra in Rishikesh, India
                  </strong>{' '}
                  (the birthplace of yoga, nestled on the mighty Ganga River) in
                  2007 and 2008 with a group. Then in 2009 I went alone to spend
                  time one on one with him, meditating by the ganga, walking
                  through the jungles, discussing wisdom, and by all means
                  developing the relationship of Guru and Student. Then one day,
                  near the banks of the Ganga river at Ram Jhula( a
                  bridge/neighborhood in Rishikesh) he said to me “Do you want
                  to come ride motorcycles with me into the Himalayas, over the
                  highest road in the world? Over 18,000ft, Ladakh India…”{' '}
                </p>
                <p class='mb-0'>
                  <strong>I was half frozen.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>
                    I mustered a smile, just to give myself a moment to think.
                  </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  You see, I did not know how to ride a motorcycle and if you
                  had seen me ride even a moped in India you would have tilted
                  your head, pulled down your glasses and said, “You, ride a
                  moto into Himalayas? You crashed a moped twice already!”
                  That’s what my ego was saying. Actually it was worse than
                  that, but another voice inside was very loudly saying “Just
                  say YES, move your lips. Adam, move your lips. Just say yes!”
                  And I did. And then, as mentioned, that Ego voice got worse,
                  “Holy crap, he is going to kill you. Are you crazy. This guy
                  has had a Vedic prophecy he will die in an accident and you’re
                  going with him!!?”{' '}
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>
                    I took a quantum leap in that moment. I chose to burst the
                    bubble of my worldview.
                  </strong>{' '}
                  The worldview was that I am not a motorcycle rider, that I
                  will die if I ride with my guru, and that I should probably
                  stay safe and think this through. Yet, I leapt and in that
                  moment I became a motorcycle rider, I committed to be beyond
                  my fears of death, and I committed to a safety that is not
                  based in security, but more based in the safety of knowing who
                  I truly am. And I did ultimately realize I am greater than my
                  expectations. Just as life is greater than our expectations of
                  it.
                </p>
                <p class='mb-0'>
                  <strong>
                    Does that mean I didn’t feel afraid every day after that
                    choice?
                  </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Of course I did. The mind came rushing back in to try and find
                  its grounding and its safety again. But a few things were
                  going on: One is that on some level I was aware that I live in
                  a bubble, a worldview that was keeping me small and hidden
                  from the truth. Secondly, I knew that to grow, to evolve, and
                  to find truth, we have to pop the bubble. Thirdly, I knew that
                  only I had created this bubble, so it must be me who will pop
                  it. And lastly, beyond all of that, I simply knew to listen to
                  the calling of Love. I knew to listen to the calling of the
                  Truth, which I see as the love of self. And I knew that I
                  desired to grow and be in the Himalayas with my master. Did I
                  have fear? Oh yes! And it came and went all throughout that
                  first trip, The Highest Pass documentary, as I was learning
                  valuable lessons. One of those lessons will really help us all
                  as we make quantum leaps in our lives and watch our minds try
                  to pull us away from those leaps. Here it is:

                    So lets break down this idea of a quantum leap - bursting
                    the bubble.

                <p class='mb-0'>
                  <strong>Become Aware that we are in a bubble. </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is a first step to making a quantum leap, is to become
                  aware of the bubble we live in our head. Most people think
                  they are free, and thus their life goes unquestioned. We must
                  first understand that we have bias and worldviews that are not
                  necessarily based in truth or freedom. On some level everyone
                  that came on this Road to Dharma journey knew that they wanted
                  freedom, but they still had an outlook on life and themselves
                  that was keeping them from it. It will help to understand what
                  those worldviews are and how they got created, because we
                  honestly waste so much of our energy and life trying to
                  maintain this bubble… Can you see that? How much time and
                  energy we use to maintain life in its comfortable bubble… how
                  much planning do you do so that you don’t feel uncomfortable?
                  Or are put in a situation that is uncomfortable. Or, another
                  example would be how much energy we waste doubting ourselves.
                  How is doubt maintenance? Well, if you are in constant doubt,
                  its due to a view of the world that isn’t content, that still
                  needs to prove itself, that isn’t accepting the way things
                  are. So, we’ll doubt ourselves and our pasts, because we

                  what is going on. This “Who am I” that we think we are is
                  created by the conditioned self. This includes conditioning
                  that we received from society, from family, and from our own
                  traumas and experiences. The conditioned self… but not the

                    <strong>The Ganga River: </strong>
                    <p>
                      For many in the Hindu religion, it is the epitome of the
                      divine mother. The holy Ganga. The mother. But often it is
                      just a religious belief, a bubble created around it, that
                      lacks deep knowing. So then they come to the Ganga and dip
                      in and she is fiercely flowing with rapids so she
                      sometimes takes them under… Then she becomes a witch! The
                      circumstances have changed and thus the view changes. So
                      the view was not truth, it was limited to the bubble of
                      belief and fantasy. If she really is the divine mother,
                      then she is that whether or not she is calm or fierce –
                      always a mother, as Anand says.{' '}

                    <strong>The Guru: </strong>
                    <p>
                      I purposefully began the episode by introducing Anand in a
                      very casual way. I wanted the audience to see him walking
                      in the jungle, joking with me about sleeping on a tree as
                      a kid. I wanted to demystify the idea of guru as an old
                      man in a cave or a person that just speaks wisdom. Anand
                      can joke around, rides a motorcycle and clearly has
                      reactions when he reads of 31 people killed in the
                      cloudburst. He is real. I did this so the audience could
                      let down their guard and also could take him off the
                      pedestal of perfection. Otherwise we look to find ways to
                      persecute the sage, to pull him down off the pedestal. So,
                      I chose to present him in the Road to Dharma in a way that
                      takes him out of the bubble that normally confines a guru
                      as having to look or act a certain way. Wouldn’t that
                      “bubble” limit what you can receive from guru? Just like
                      the river, if he is spouting wisdom one might love him and
                      if he is making fun of you or making you feel
                      uncomfortable, you might hate him… And, some people might
                      never listen to him if he is presented as all too pious.

                      People are usually good until they come into difficult
                      circumstances. Then the truth comes out. The true stories
                      that are running in the background. We go deeply into
                      uncovering these stories we have of ourselves in
                      Episode/Chapter Two... but for now its enough to know that
                      we have been told by others who we are, we have been told
                      by society what will make us happy, and we have been
                      informed by experiences how we can stay safe in life. All
                      this will need to crack open to find freedom.{' '}

                    Courage to pop it. Leap beyond what we believe and perceive.
                  </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  We realize our worldview is holding us back, that it enslaves
                  us, and that it is taking so much of our time and energy to
                  keep this bubble afloat. But nonetheless, it takes great
                  courage and willingness to take an action that pops it, that
                  shatters it. In fact this popping it is in fact the quantum
                  leap. This is where that inspirational quote “More love than
                  fear,” is very appropriate and helpful. We are not going to
                  wait until we aren’t afraid. We are not going to wait until
                  things are comfortable. We are not going to let the “Ifs and
                  Buts” get in the way. We aren’t waiting to finish the past or
                  wait for a utopic future. In fact, we might want to realize
                  that when we feel challenged and uncomfortable, we are being
                  given an opportunity to pop our bubble, to take a quantum
                  leap. These are the cues that its time to step up, not recoil
                  and wait until it’s all better. Usually, we seek escape routes
                  in this moment, which we will talk about in Chapter Three, and
                  avoid taking the leap. But it is our intention and great
                  commitment, when seeking freedom, that we take the leap. To
                  me, most of it is internal. It might take the form of external
                  action, and the bubble might pop because of new circumstance
                  and an external journey or pilgrimage, but usually that’s all
                  a result of the internal “aha” or “Love” that you are
                  following.

                  <strong>When does the leap occur? Now.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  I don’t mean now as you read, but maybe. I mean that all leaps
                  happen in the now. What that means for us is that we must be
                  in the present moment. You don’t leap when stuck in the past
                  or in the future. So come into the present at those moments
                  where you can feel your world crumbling… and then leap. Anand
                  speaks in more detail about this in the Bonus Footage dharma
                  talk at the end of this Chapter. For me, at the banks of the
                  Ganga back in 2009, I could see my whole life being challenged
                  by this offer to ride on The Highest Pass and I made my lips
                  say “Yes.” However, it didn’t stop there. There were so many
                  more leaps along the that first journey to The Highest Pass…
                  one happened when we visited an Oracle.{' '}

                  <strong>
                    It never ends. The attitude of freedom has us make leap
                    after leap.{' '}

                </p>
                <p>
                  While on the Highest Pass journey we journeyed to Ladakh,
                  India, which is a region of Himalayan mountains and plateau
                  that is all over 11,000ft. It is all very steeped in Tibetan
                  Buddhism. While there we had the opportunity to go see an
                  Oracle. An oracle is someone that channels spirit. The Dali
                  Lama himself has a personal oracle that he consults with for
                  counsel. Despite this, even making space in one’s perception
                  for an experience with a spiritual channel is itself something
                  that can crack the mind’s hold on reality.{' '}

                <p class='mb-0'>
                  <strong>Asking the Oracle a question.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  I had thought about this and decided that I would internally
                  ask the question “Whatever is most beneficial for my
                  evolution, may I receive that.” Embedded in this very question
                  is realizing that I have a worldview that more than likely is
                  confined. Thus realizing that any question from “me” probably
                  comes from my bubble. But, I’d like to grow beyond my limited
                  knowing.... So lets take the attitude of being open to not
                  even knowing the question to ask. Do you feel me on this? It’s
                  like realizing that life might be giving you the lessons you
                  need rather than what you thought you needed. So, opening up
                  to that possibility is a “popping of the bubble,” a
                  relinquishing of control. This is a leap, letting go.{' '}
                </p>
                <p>
                  Interested in what the oracle said to me and to all of us?
                  It’s a beautiful scene in The Highest Pass documentary, worth
                  experiencing, but I’ll tell you some. She said I “You have a
                  good heart. Have lead many good lifetimes. Lucky man. And you
                  do not need to cause any more suffering or hurt anything
                  anymore.” I get emotional writing it as I know this heart and
                  I also know that I lost some of it on the Road to Dharma, as
                  you’ll see in episode 10. But recently in 2018 on another
                  motorcycle journey (not filmed), I reclaimed that heart. It’s
                  been a long journey and again goes to show that it never ends
                  and that it’s the attitude of freedom that has us continually
                  make leap after leap.

                <p>
                  The meaning of Dharma, like the journey to being free, will
                  evolve and take on more meaning for you as you watch the
                  episodes and read the chapters. I don’t want to fully define
                  it as it needs some flexibility and space for you to feel it
                  for yourself. It takes on many meanings and Dharma needs the
                  ability to deepen and change as you deepen and change. What I
                  offer up now as a base for us is this:{' '}

                  <strong>Dharma is that Truth.</strong>
                </p>

                  <strong>And Dharma is also the path to that Truth.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our intention in the Road to Dharma (and in this course) is to
                  find freedom. And the Truth sets us Free, as I have said. Thus
                  this Road to Dharma becomes a journey to the find truth
                  (Dharma) and thus to find freedom. However, The Road To Dharma
                  is also about learning and realizing the Path to the truth.
                  What I mean is that the path (or method) to find the truth is
                  also as important as the destination/wisdom. In living the
                  path, we are living the truth, living the freedom. The method
                  (the path) is the dharma and thus the method is freedom too.
                  Why is this important? Because the truth, much like you, is
                  also ever growing and expanding, so it has to also include the
                  path to it. And so the road we are on (the journey to four
                  sacred peaks) will show us how to embody the Path to Truth… it
                  will show us a way of Being that exemplifies that truth, that
                  freedom; Freedom must also include the way of Living in
                  Freedom.

                  I started this lesson walking along the Ganga River with my
                  guru. Now, I want to leave you with a some lasting advice he
                  got while walking along the Ganga with his guru, Maraji. As
                  you’ll see in Chapter Ten, Maraji was a true master that even
                  chose the exact moment he would pass on from this world. He
                  would rarely talk, mostly transmitting wisdom to Anand in
                  silence… So I love these stories of his actual words of
                  wisdom. This is just one of the nuggets you’ll also find in
                  the bonus interview with Anand about his guru and growing up

                      Life is greater than our expectations, thankfully so. That

                      we would be in big trouble. People would be falling off
                      the edges, because they expected that if you walk far
                      enough you would fall of the edge of the earth.

                  CHARACTER VIRTUES: SEEING WISDOM IN ACTION
                </h5>
                <p>
                  When we watch stories on television, we empathize with
                  characters. We feel scared with them, we hope for redemption
                  for them, we cheer for them, and something about them
                  resonates with us. Hopefully what resonates are their virtues
                  and strengths. Why? Because then we will be motivated to
                  cultivate those virtues. Am I saying that by watching TV we
                  can improve ourselves? Yes. That’s what story at its origin
                  was meant to do, not dumb us down and make us addicted.
                  Conscious media will unshackle you. You walk out empowered.
                  That is the goal of The Road To Dharma. To entertain you and
                  also to unshackle you! To help you find your freedom.{' '}
                </p>
                <p>
                  Here are the main virtues/strengths as laid out by the VIA
                  INSTITUTE ON CHARACTER, a global leader in the practice of
                  character, and as seen in the deeply insightful book: POSITIVE
                  PYSCHOLOGY AT THE MOVIES 2. It is a set of virtues that those
                  in the media world and beyond have come to understand make for
                  a better human being, that we would all want to cultivate… and
                  thus would want to show in stories to teach people how to be
                  better people. Lets have a look at the six major virtues and
                  their sub virtues.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>COURAGE:</strong> Bravery, Honesty, Perseverance,
                    Zest.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>HUMANITY: </strong> Love, Kindness, Social
                    Intelligence
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>WISDOM & KNOWLEDGE: </strong>Creativity, Curiosity,
                    Judgment, Love of Learning, Perspective
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>TRANSCENDENCE: </strong>Gratitude, Hope, Humor,
                    Spirituality, Appreciation
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>JUSTICE: </strong>Teamwork, Fairness, Leadership
                    <p>
                      *I personally like the word Inclusivity, which I feel
                      falls in Teamwork and Fairness.{' '}
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>TEMPERANCE: </strong> Forgiveness, Humility,
                    Prudence, Self-Regulation.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  These are also qualities to reinforce and that give us greater
                  access to freedom. Let’s see how the characters embodied this
                  (or didn’t.) and how it brings to light the wisdoms and
                  realizations of the episode. Also note that for your ease, we
                  have included the specific clips from the episode, so you can
                  easily watch the section again without scrolling through the
                  video.{' '}

                <h5 class='chapter-subheading'>FRED’S SEARCH FOR IDENTITY</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>COURAGE: bravery, honesty, and perseverance. </li>
                  <li>WISDOM AND KNOWLEDGE: Curiosity, Love of Learning </li>

                <p>
                  You really have to love and admire Fred. The man is 75 years
                  old and fully admits that his identity has based solely on his
                  career. He even goes as far as to say that he would like to
                  know what it means to be “Human.” It shows that he has
                  definitely embodied <strong>Honesty</strong> and{' '}
                  <strong>Love of Learning.</strong> He has also embodied the
                  wisdom of realizing he is living in a bubble. Realizing also
                  that it’s his worldview of self that has created that bubble.
                  And then at 75 years old, having not ridden in 40 years, signs
                  up for a motorcycle journey in the Himalayas… what?! Amazing
                  spirit and <strong>Bravery.</strong> His{' '}
                  <strong>Perseverance</strong> shows after he falls down,
                  tearing up the skin on his arm. He gets right back up, wraps
                  it in bandanas and off he goes again on the bike.{' '}
                </p>
                <p>
                  Anand recognizes this spirit in Fred. Anand and I spoke behind
                  the scenes about Fred and if he was capable or not. He
                  revealed to me how deeply important it is to honor Fred’s deep
                  intention in coming here. It deeply touched Anand that an
                  older person was really willing and committed to changing his
                  life, even at 75… to even risk his life for the truth that he
                  had hidden from for so long. I learned a lot by seeing how
                  Anand cared for Fred and honored Fred’s intention. We see more
                  of Anand really giving Fred all the support he can in Episodes
                  Two and Three and really throughout the whole series.{' '}

                  This clip shows Fred discussing his identity, his fall, and
                  then his deep <strong>Gratitude</strong> for being on the

                  TIFFANY – THE FEMININE ROLE MODEL
                </h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>COURAGE: Bravery.</li>
                  <li>JUSTICE: Leadership</li>
                  <li>TRANSCENDENCE: Spirituality</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Tiffany has a three-year-old son who she’s leaving for the
                  first time. She’ll be gone for three weeks on a motorcycle on
                  some of the most treacherous roads in the world and everyone
                  she tells thinks she’s crazy. Yet as Anand says “If you have
                  not been called crazy you have never lived.” What does he
                  mean? If you have never questioned the norm, gone beyond
                  what’s safe for others and life, then you are playing too
                  small and never realizing who you really are. He means that we
                  should not give into society’s limited conditioned way of
                  thinking. And you’ll hear him reference Krishnamurti later in
                  the series, “To be well adjusted to a sick society is no
                  measure of health.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tiffany wants to give her son a feminine role model that is
                  adventurous, that follows her calling and risks what is known
                  for a greater understanding. She wants him to see the feminine
                  in that way… She is showing her <srrong>Leadership</srrong> in
                  this way. And she doesn’t expect others or even her parents to
                  understand that. Why didn’t she tell her parents? I can only
                  imagine she didn’t want to hear all the reasons why not to go…
                  Don’t we have enough of our own fears without those from
                  others too? And when we have the “Aha!” moment, and the bubble
                  pops, we need to have <srrong>Courage</srrong> to follow it.
                  Her desire for <srrong>Spirituality</srrong> outweighs the
                  fearful mind. But as we’ll see in Episode Four, that fearful
                  mind isn’t gone, it hasn’t just disappeared. That’s why we
                  learned in this chapter to simply have More Love than Fear. I
                  also included a special talk on that in the bonus footage.{' '}

                  So in Ryan’s past he fell off some scaffolding, broke his
                  collarbone, some ribs and subsequently starting having
                  seizures after that point. Then one day when riding his
                  motorcycle home from work, he took a seizure while going
                  through a high-speed turn, flipped his bike and had a massive
                  concussion. His doctor stopped him from riding. He admittedly
                  thought he would never ride again. Anand could tell he was
                  meant to be on the Road To Dharma, it was time for Ryan to
                  make a leap… we’ll see that Ryan’s arc and leaps continue
                  throughout the whole series, as they do in life in general.
                  But it is this first desire to say “Yes, I’m coming to India
                  to ride and find myself, to find peace in all areas of my
                  life.” This is the first leap. Again, he was not yet cleared
                  to ride by his doctor, and wasn’t sure he would be cleared,
                  but goes about raising money for this trip. He has faith.

                  All riders paid for their own journeys, in fact people only
                  knew it would be filmed just about a month before. This wasn’t
                  a “casted” show. I think you see that in Ryan’s sincerity
                  throughout the journey. He truly wants to transform and you
                  can see he is <strong>Grateful</strong> to even be here
                  riding. “Peace love and motorcycles, I love motorcycles,” he
                  says… But he wasn’t expecting night riding, nor was he
                  expecting night riding during the rain. More on that in
                  Chapter Two. The point is, he is <strong>Grateful</strong> to
                  even be able to be here, able to ride, and able to afford the
                  opportunity. He is <strong>Humble</strong> in that he knows
                  the dangers of riding, first hand. And yet despite that he is
                  incredibly <strong>Brave.</strong>{' '}

                  DHARMA WISDOM TALKS by HIMALAYAN MASTER ANAND MEHROTRA

                  As you can imagine, we can only show parts of the full talks
                  that Anand gives. But in this bonus footage you get to hear
                  the full discussion and really digest this wisdom. The quantum
                  leap talk takes place near a temple outside of Rishikesh
                  called Kunja Puri, which is also the place where Anand gave an
                  impactful talk during The Highest Pass. We’ve decided to give
                  you that talk as well because it hits on that very important
                  tool I have mentioned: “Have more love than fear!” In the
                  talks you will hear Anand talk about:

                  Please Listen to this First. In this intro I explain how
                  important the actual practice is and why. I then outline the
                  structure of these audio meditations and why we use breath,
                  movement and sound (mantra) to help shift the energetic body
                  radically.{' '}

                  <strong>CHAPTER ONE MEDITATION PRACTICE:</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this audio meditation I’ll first connect us to the earth,
                  air and sun. This is the “greater body” that also keeps us
                  alive. This alone expands our bubble and reminds us we are
                  part of something greater. We will then bring in the Cosmic
                  Breath 1 practice and Cosmic Breath 2 practice. Then I’ll
                  guide us to expand our awareness. And finally bring in a
                  mantra that helps us tap into totality. When in this most
                  expansive worldview, it becomes easier to accept challenges
                  and make the leap… ultimately allows for our greatness to
                  reveal itself.
                </p>
                <p class='mb-0'>
                  <strong>MANTRA: AHAM BRAMASMI </strong>
                </p>
                <p>( Ah-Hum Bra-Mah-Smee</p>
                <p>AHAM (I am) BRAMASMI (Totality)</p>
                <p>
                  This specific mantra is to help us realize we are greater than
                  we think we are. This will help tap us into the part of us
                  that is Totality. This will help us take the leap, because we
                  are less attached to the small “I” that is the small story of
                  us we will look deeper at in Chapter Two.

                  You’re still trying to define who we are through these
                  experiences instead of realizing that these experiences are
                  the expression of the brilliance of who we are and the
                  invitation is to get deeper within the truth of self. There’s
                  nothing more powerful than that.
