                  <p>
                    In this chapter we dive into the Death of Ego. Yeah, no big
                    deal, right? Well, it is possible and possibly simple.
                    Specifically, we will look the tendencies of Ego called
                    Craving and Aversion. In episode three of The Road To
                    Dharma, we arrive at our first sacred peak, Kedarnath, which
                    represents Shiva and Death. Shiva isn’t a religious hell.
                    Nor is Shiva a right or wrong. Shiva represents
                    death/destruction. This is the destruction of the pitiful
                    little “I”, this “What about me?”  that has lost its power
                    to circumstances. But, we can get our power and freedom
                    back! When we transcend this, we are Liberated (in that
                    moment) to a greater sense of self, a greater freedom.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We'll explore these wisdoms and show how Elle quantum leaps
                    out of her bubble, how Fred embodies character virtues of
                    Honesty, and how Jen Perseveres and has the Courage to go
                    beyond her failing body and mind, finding freedom by using a
                    sacred mantra.  Video snippets from each of the characters,
                    the special never before seen full-version of Anand’s talk
                    at the lake above Kedarnath, and the audio meditation
                    practice for the strength to transcend, are all yours to
                    enjoy on your Road to Dharma, Chapter Three.

                  <h5 class='chapter-heading'>HOW THESE CHAPTERS FLOW</h5>
                  <p>
                    <strong>
                      Although I explained this in Chapter One, I’ll review it
                      again here as this Chapter Three is the free chapter that
                      some people are jumping right into for the first time.
                    </strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    First, you’ll watch the episode, knowing what the general
                    topic of the chapter is, and you’ll see the lesson on
                    freedom jump out at you. Then you’ll read the Chapter where
                    we explore the wisdom of freedom in real down-to-earth
                    language and detail. Then we break the wisdom down into
                    bullet points for your easy reference. Next we explore how
                    the characters in the show embody that wisdom by showing you
                    video clips and discussing the virtues/character strengths
                    they exhibit. By watching and relating to them, you can
                    cultivate these virtues for your own freedom.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Lastly, we finish off by taking you deep into the journey in
                    the Himalayas again, with the unseen bonus footage filmed
                    during The Road To Dharma. These deep discussions are with
                    master yogi Anand Mehrotra. As you can imagine, only pieces
                    can make it into a show, but now you get to see the whole
                    thing, as if you were right there on a journey. And then
                    finally we’ll leave you with an audio meditation practice
                    that combines pranayama, kriya, and mantra. The goal of
                    these powerful yet compact practices is for you to feel and
                    shift your energy to embody this aspect of freedom, and do
                    realize you can do so in a matter of 20-30 minutes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now, I am a realist and I realize that you might just binge
                    watch the whole series at once and then come back and read
                    the chapters. That’s fine. Get into it. Take the journey.
                    Then, when you come back and read a chapter, watch the
                    episode again. You’ll experience the episode in a very
                    different manner. The teaching will deepen. And the power of
                    watching a real journey is that you feel emotions, the mind
                    actually has neurons firing like you are there, you
                    empathize, and you receive the experience. And so, if you
                    are watching with the wisdom in mind, then you are
                    translating the experience into deep understanding even
                    quicker. And then one day, perhaps you can see your life as
                    objectively as a movie that you are here to learn through…
                    but we’ll talk about that later.

                    CHAPTER THREE: FREEDOM FROM EGO
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                    <strong>
                      I’ll start by relating an experience from my first
                      documentary film, The Highest Pass.
                    </strong>
                     So on this documentary film I had a co-producer. We were in
                    post production (editing the film) and along the way it was
                    super clear that we were not going to meet our deadline date
                    for having the first edit of the film. This is important for
                    keeping within the budget of the film. And this clearly
                    stressed out my co producer. But that’s not the exact point,
                    in fact feeling that pressure or stress is quite natural.
                    What was most striking was that whenever we faced the
                    reality of not meeting the looming deadline (and it happened
                    a few times), he would come up with a new strategy for
                    meeting the deadline. Sounds normal right? Not if the new
                    strategy is completely impossible as well, and we won’t meet
                    those new strategy/goal posts.  But what did the new
                    strategy achieve?  It made him feel better in the moment,
                    like all was good and under control. But it was really a
                    lie. It was total escapism. He never had to actually deeply
                    feel the reality of us not being on schedule (the
                    circumstance). He went right to aversion of that feeling.
                    And then created a strategy that would make him feel good
                    again; craving.  But in reality nothing changed. Same story.
                    We were late and the lie of the Ego feeling good for a while
                    continued onward… as Anand says in Episode three “It’s been
                    going on for ages, what’s new.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>
                      Craving and Aversion – this is the pattern of the ego mind
                      – it is the constant seeking of a secure and most
                      comfortable space.
                    </strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>
                      How much of our time is spent trying to imagine, secure,
                      or create the future that is safe/secure and won’t make us
                      ever have to feel an “averse” state?
                    </strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>
                      And likewise, how much of our energy is set up trying to
                      have the thing we “crave?”
                    </strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So much mental energy is used on this! How often do we fight
                    the current situation and strategize out of it (which is
                    escapism), rather than embracing and feeling and being with
                    it all. Is it possible there is something else there to
                    see/learn, rather than escaping to a time or place that will
                    feel better? Maybe what one person perceives as “lost and
                    afraid,” another person perceives as “beautiful, quiet…”
                    That’s what Aizhan was going through at the top of Kedarnath
                    in Episode Three. She felt lost and afraid, while others
                    thought it was beautiful. How is that possible? Because one
                    person is in a triggered craving/averting state and the
                    other person is simply being and seeing what is.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>
                      One person is in conflict with what is and one person is
                      at present with what is.
                    </strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I really feel we need to say this again. It is so simple.
                    This could save your from really blowing up a situation up,
                    and better yet, could guide you to using the moment for
                    living a life of freedom.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>
                      One person is in conflict with what is and one person is
                      at present with what is.
                    </strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And so, Anand hits us with Craving and Aversion right at the
                    beginning of Episode Three. It’s so profound and simple:
                    Craving and Aversion – you see it everywhere – this has been
                    the battleground of the mind for ages, and for our whole
                    lives. Yet, it’s not that we are born this way. Yes, we are
                    born and programmed for survival, which one might see as
                    craving and aversion on some level, but society reinforces a
                    false craving. What is this false craving? Usually it’s
                    rooted in the conditioned feeling of ‘not enough’ or
                    ‘needing to prove’ or ‘things should be different” or
                    “comparison.” And to me, the pilgrimage is a perfect way to
                    push the comfort zone so that the hidden demons come out and
                    we get to work with them. The demons are the hidden violence
                    waiting to happen. The violence is always there lurking. And
                    to me the most inviting and exciting thing of being a yogi
                    is that we purposefully go looking to expose the craving and
                    aversion, the ego, our demons…this is a true search for
                    freedom.

                    Hiding in the ultra comfortable or hiding in a cave, neither
                    is the way in these modern times. But if we first look at
                    modern times, it has really spread this notion that the
                    ideal state or “freedom state” is to create total control
                    and comfort. Just look at how controlled our lives are to
                    avert feeling bad. Heated seats in the car, the perfect
                    outfit for each weather condition, hoarding of money and
                    resources so we never feel threatened… And that is all the
                    false sense of freedom as laid down by law in modern times.
                      And secondly, I would say society normally pins judgment
                    on the yogi as the person in the cave not willing to really
                    “deal with life.” There are times when retreat is necessary,
                    but my view is we are in time of bringing the awareness out
                    of the cave and letting it hit the pavement. So, we are
                    realizing the modern ideals are false – comfort won’t bring
                    freedom.  And realizing the modern yogi must be out of the
                    cave with both feet in the world and willing to (like in the
                    Tibetan Buddhist traditions of the Himalayas and the Yogic
                    teachings of Anand’s Himalayan lineage) face the demons and
                    bring them up and slay them. It might be easy to be at peace
                    when you don’t do anything challenging, including staying in
                    a cave…  but go take a quantum leap, do something out of the
                    box, and commit to the learning and expansion... Then your
                    demons will come up. You bubble will burst. And there is
                    Shiva, helping you destroy it. I’ll outline what Shiva is
                    all about later in this chapter.

                    but in the end we come out gold, because after the death via
                    Shiva is the regeneration via the feminine and that’s what
                    we see in Chapter Five; Freedom in the Gap. There, we see
                    that the creation sits above the destruction at the sacred
                    peak of Tungnath. But for now, it’s the exposing of the
                    demons… and their destruction!

                      And the first step in destruction, in death, is allowing

                    able to stop that cycle.

                        When in a triggered state, you will use your mind to

                    So instead of reacting to Craving and from Aversion, we have
                    to actually Accept what is occurring and accept how we are
                    feeling.  Those two things are key.  Eventually
                    transformation will occur. Transcendence is probably even a
                    greater word to use. Transcendence will occur. We go beyond
                    it. 
                    <strong>
                      First we must be Aware of, then secondly we Accept/Allow,
                      thirdly Transcend.
                    </strong>
                     I tend to use the word Allow instead of accept, as accept
                    feels too passive for most people in our modern culture.
                    Allow is what I’ll use from here on out.

                    Usually us humans we might, and I do stress “might,” do the
                    first step and “become Aware of the circumstance, feeling
                    and reaction.” But we rarely even do that. My co producer,
                    he felt stressed. That’s for sure. But was he aware that he
                    kept averting that feeling? Doubt it. He was aware on some
                    level he was stressed. I mean look, we are aware of the
                    discomfort but are we aware it’s just the mind? Are we aware
                    of our responsibility to the reaction to the craving and
                    aversion?

                    <strong>
                      We must be aware of that! We must have awareness of the
                      pattern before we can realize the main hindrances that are
                      stopping us from transcendence and ultimately true
                      freedom.

                  <p>
                    What are those hindrances that stop transcendence?  We tend
                    to BLAME and we tend to ESCAPE. Blame others. Escape through
                    strategy , through future, through substance, through
                    anything other than watching the mind and actually feeling.

                      How do we get past these hindrances and develop a practice

                    How can we rewire our brain for awareness? And how can we
                    practice Allowing?  <strong>Meditation</strong>.  But let me
                    be clear, not all meditation brings this clarity and
                    insight. A guided body relaxation meditation for 20 minutes
                    is helpful, but won’t bring us to insight, or deep
                    transcendence. It might give us glimpses of peace and help
                    reset the brain, which can aid awareness. Yes, for sure, no
                    doubt. And honestly the first meditation I ever encountered
                    (at age 18) was a body relaxation meditation. However, I am
                    inviting us now toward a focused meditation that integrates
                    enquiry. In the meditations in this course, we use a lot of
                    pranayama, kriya, and mantra to shift the energetic body
                    quickly. This is key for realizing the power we have and
                    bringing about expanded awareness. And beyond these audio
                    meditations, I invite you to take longer time on your own,
                    to be in silence and enquire as to the true nature of
                    yourself and the mind. Noting the pattern of the mind. Not
                    needing things to change and thus watching/observing our
                    needs.  Then having the courage to not change/react. The
                    courage to be, and the courage to see what happens.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Let me offer a bit more on this. The Road to Dharma
                    meditations, which use Mantra, Kriya, and Pranayama, shift
                    our state – so we feel beyond our normal self, so we touch
                    that place and get expanded. This can really help us then be
                    more Aware. How? Because as we are expanded, on an energetic
                    level, we have more aptitude to be with a feeling. Why?
                    Because we feel bigger than it, bigger than the little
                    circumstance. We feel more connected, enlivened, and thus
                    less identified or attached to a feeling. Thus, we have a
                    chance of Allowing a feeling. Like the parent who is
                    balanced and in a good mood, the kid acts out and there is
                    some patience and ability to deal with the child lovingly,
                    rather than react to the child in a trigger themselves. We
                    can cultivate that. We are the parent. Our ego is the child.
                    That’s what the meditations/kriyas that we have in each
                    chapter are helping to do. They help us expand, so that we
                    can have the courage to be with a feeling. We won’t need to
                    change or react to it. Then we can see what might occur when
                    we allow it...  Will we really die from that itch? Does life
                    fall apart if we don’t do something now… or is the world
                    fine? Does the pain or anger or feeling transform? Or is it
                    our relationship to it that transforms? Practice and see.
                    You must see for yourself and realize the power you have to
                    choose.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is key: Just by being with it, you are choosing to be
                    beyond it and choosing to evolve. This already is courage.
                    This already is freedom.

                        death stakes on a pilgrimage, but it can be simply a

                        anywhere you are willing to use the journey to explore…

                    This approach to life starts to really rewire the brain
                    dramatically and take hold as experience. What approach?
                    When we use the challenges (as shown by craving and
                    aversion) to grow us rather than to satisfy the itch. That
                    is the key approach. Then, with practice, a sense of

                    CHARACTER VIRTUES & SPECIFIC MOMENTS WE SEE THE TEACHINGS
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                    When we watch stories on television, we empathize with
                    characters. We feel scared with them, we hope for redemption
                    for them, we cheer for them, and something about them
                    resonates with us. Hopefully what resonates are their
                    virtues and strengths. Here is a reminder of the six major
                    virtues and their sub virtues.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Why? Because then we will be motivated to cultivate those
                    virtues. Am I saying that by watching TV we can improve
                    ourselves? Yes. That’s what story at its origin was meant to
                    do, not dumb us down and make us addicted. Conscious media
                    will unshackle you. You walk out empowered. That is the goal
                    of The Road To Dharma., To entertain you and also to
                    unshackle you! To help you find your freedom.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Here are the main virtues/strengths as laid out by the VIA
                    INSTITUTE ON CHARACTER, a global leader in the practice of
                    character, and as seen in the deeply insightful book:
                    POSITIVE PYSCHOLOGY AT THE MOVIES 2. It is a set of virtues
                    that those in the media world and beyond have come to
                    understand make for a better human being, that we would all
                    want to cultivate… and thus would want to show in stories to
                    teach people how to be better people. Let’s have a look at
                    the six major virtues and their sub virtues.

                  <p>
                    At the beginning of Episode Three, Elle decides to not wait
                    until she is a good rider to embody this energy. It’s
                    something Anand taught her in Episode Two and she now really
                    took hold of. Riding in mud like this is hard for even
                    seasoned riders, but she embodied the energy of calm, she
                    took herself to a place beyond where her mind was fixed. She
                    leapt before knowing! This is so key. This is{' '}
                    <strong>Brave</strong>. This is{' '}
                    <strong>Perseverance</strong>. I’ll say it again another
                    way. She leapt into the unknown. She trusted before she
                    understood. This is breaking out of the bubble. This is
                    going beyond the story into the unknown. This is the death
                    of the old (the Shiva) and emergence of something greater.
                    This is <strong>Transcendence</strong>. To leap, one lets go
                    of the old, it dies. And of course to do that she must go
                    beyond the craving and aversion. Craving of what?  Craving
                    the feeling that she thinks others might have that are
                    experienced riders. She would think that to them it feels so
                    easy and like a joy ride.  Aversion of what? Aversion of the
                    pain in the body, the fear of death, and of the reality that
                    you can fall.  Of course we want to skip the hard work and
                    just feel like it feels once we are experts and never have
                    to push through the fear of the failure… but we can’t grow
                    if we don’t go beyond this false idea of waiting for
                    conditions to be right before you leap. Growth means you
                    leap before you know.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The beauty of Elle’s story in this episode is that it’s
                    clearly not a goal or endpoint. What I mean is we don’t just
                    leap once and its all good. “Like yeah, I leapt, now its all
                    good. I did The Highest Pass so I’ve conquered all my
                    fears.” Apparently, I haven’t yet. You know this if you’ve
                    seen Episode 9 and Episode 10 and my experiences there. So,
                    the leaping is continual.  And so we see that later in the
                    episode when confronted again with craving and aversion
                    while climbing to the lake, Elle loses her cool. This is
                    when she blames me.  Instead of showing Transcendence, the
                    falls into blame. She seeks to escape.{' '}
                    <strong>No Courage. No Transcendence</strong>. And we learn
                    again that the demands of evolution are never ending.

                  <p>COURAGE: Honesty, Perseverance.</p>
                  <p>WISDOM AND KNOWLEDGE: Curiosity & Love of Learning</p>
                  <p>TEMPERANCE: Humility</p>
                  <p>
                    Why do we keep loving Fred so much in this show? Am I right?
                    I think it is that <strong>Courage</strong> to be{' '}
                    <strong>Honest</strong> in his quest to continually{' '}
                    <strong>Learn</strong>… even at age 75… learning from a man
                    (Anand) half his age.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We respect and admire this because these qualities will lead
                    him to wisdom, to freedom. And this is something we all
                    want. Yet are we willing to be <strong>Honest</strong>,{' '}
                    <strong>Humble</strong>, wrong? How can we really find this
                    road to truth if we are not willing to be{' '}
                    <strong>Honest</strong>. That is a key virtue. And then
                    willing to <strong>Persevere</strong> when the truth hurts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Here is the wisdom we are reminded of through Fred’s{' '}
                    <strong>Honest</strong> inquiry to Anand at the base of
                    Kedarnath (“Shiva is Hell right?”): Anand tells us that
                    Shiva isn’t a hell, its not from a religious “do or don’t”.
                    Shiva is death of the self-serving individual, the pitiful
                    greedy self-concerned ego. We rarely release our hold to the
                    ego, our attachment to it, in order to let it die.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What is the ego though? It’s such a broad topic, but we
                    define it as a frequency of fear, lack, and need for safety.
                    It’s a frequency like a radio station… that we tune into.
                    Much like the stories are frequencies on a radio, as we
                    spoke about in Episode Two. Ego is the frequency of an
                    overarching story that we often take as identity. But let me
                    be super clear, identity is not ego. Ego is a frequency,
                    that our identity (and subconscious mind) sometimes latches
                    onto as our main “who am I.” When our identity latches on to
                    that frequency often enough, we start to think it is us. We
                    identify with it. And we feel like we have become a being
                    that always seeks to avoid fear, seeks safety, and is
                    greedy/self centered in its lack. But I am not the Ego. You
                    are not the Ego. So we don’t have to destroy our identity,
                    but we must unlatch our identity from the frequency of ego.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So it is this ego, this frequency of thought that must die
                    (be detached from identity). Otherwise we will bow at the
                    feet of craving and aversion forever.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, if we do let the ego die then we will find a life
                    of purpose, as we see in Chapter Eight… Freedom leads to
                    purpose!

                    JEN’S EPIC HIKE UP KEDARNATH
                  </h5>
                  <p>COURAGE: Perseverance.</p>
                  <p>TEMPERANCE: Hope</p>
                  <p>TRANSCENDANCE: Spirituality.</p>
                  <p>
                    Half way up through the hike to Kedarnath, Jen is super
                    tired and asks Anand for help.{' '}
                    <strong>
                      Anand explains to her that she must first know that she is
                      already at the top of Kedarnath. In fact she is at the
                      top, the bottom and right here… they all have already
                      occurred.
                    </strong>{' '}
                    So if she embodies the “Jen” that is already at the top then
                    she is, like Elle, making the leap. She is{' '}
                    <strong>Transcending</strong> the body/mind and embracing
                    the spirit of the Jen that is atop. She is also embracing{' '}
                    <strong>Hope</strong>. And with that <strong>Hope</strong>{' '}
                    she then asks Anand what to do when the mind starts going
                    array.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Anand gives her a mantra she can repeat in her mind for the
                    next 4 hours of a steep, intense, and cold hike. She stays
                    with that mantra. She <strong>Perseveres</strong> and she
                    goes so fast up the mountain that her husband Jeff cannot
                    catch her. And one thing we did not capture on camera, but
                    Jen spoke of, was that she had uncontrollable tears when she
                    got to the top. Crying and crying. When we go beyond the
                    aversions… something will alter, will{' '}
                    <strong>Transcend</strong>… the crying could be the death of
                    an old sense of self… or could be the outward affects we see
                    of something transforming.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Personally, I love a good cry. It means something is
                    shifting… finally.

                    DHARMA WISDOM TALKS by HIMALAYAN MASTER ANAND MEHROTRA
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                    But lets digress from emotion and characters and give you
                    access to some further wisdom. As you can imagine, the talk
                    Anand gives the group at the lake above Kedarnath
                    (13,000ft), had to be condensed for the show. But now you
                    have you access to the entire talk in its original form. I
                    can honestly say that I have experienced this talk over ten
                    times and continue to find more depth, to be cracked open
                    (often to tears), and brought back to a simplicity that I
                    consider true power and strength.
                  </p>
                  <p>In the talk we hear about:</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In this audio meditation I’ll first get us incredibly
                    grounded and strong in our spine. We need this strong sense
                    of self and spine in order to stay present when circumstance
                    hits. We start with the eight-part breath of Sukha Shunya,
                    which really demands our focus and helps stop the wandering
                    mind. Then we bring in Agni Sara that uses strong pumping
                    with the breath is in inhaled and exhaled retention. This
                    develops a strong sense of the true self. Then with focus
                    here we will bring in the mantra for transcending
                    circumstance. You’ll remember that Jen used this mantra, so
                    you know it works.
                  </p>
                  <p class='mb-0'>
                    <strong>OM NAMAH SHIVAYA</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (Ohm Nah-Mah Shee-Vai-Ya)To go beyond the circumstance, is
                    to call on that which is beyond time, that part of you that
                    isn’t small, that part of you that knows you are greater
                    than you think. OM NAMAH SHIVAYA is a Shiva mantra.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By chanting OM NAMAH SHIVAYA we are asking ourselves to rise
                    up: I am beyond the body, beyond the mind, beyond the
                    circumstance, not bound by time. I am awareness. And as the
                    circumstances dissolve I see that I am timeless, boundless,
                    I am the infinite. I am free.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I surrender my lower self into the true self. I die to all
                    ignorance. I recognize the fierce freedom within me.
                  </p>
                  <p>This is a great mantra to use in challenging times.</p>

                    The True Invitation of this life is to discover the truth of
                    who you are. And that's the only thing that will set us
                    Free. Because the truth of who you are is incomparable to
                    any image you have of yourself.
