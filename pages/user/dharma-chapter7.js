                    If you are really sincere about living a transcendent life,
                    a life of freedom, you need to lead wherever you are. This
                    is our duty, it is our dharma. Not only to ourselves but to
                    each and every one. Don’t underestimate how deeply you can
                    impact everybody’s journey just by the way you are being.

                  <p>
                    Why do we hide from our own true power? Are afraid to fail?
                    Are we afraid of becoming worthy of that power and the
                    responsibility it bears? In this Chapter of The Road To
                    Dharma we realize that fear, hiding, and a sense of
                    unworthiness are all very cunning stories that keep us from
                    accepting who we truly are, who you are! You, like the
                    riders in the series, are powerful.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In Episode Seven we go to The Hidden Valley of the Flowers,
                    an appropriate name as we will uncover the hidden power that
                    is within us all. But food is limited and a big drama causes
                    issues among the group.  Ryan, who prefers to keep
                    “peaceful” and not cause conflict, will learn that he is
                    really hiding/escaping in his stories of “peace.” His
                    stories of “hurting others” are keeping him from accepting
                    his power. We all get to see that it is{' '}
                    <strong>
                      our Responsibility, our Duty, and our Dharma is To Stand
                      In Power.
                    </strong>{' '}
                    This will liberate us and those around us... And this will
                    set us up for Chapter Eight where we explore our true
                    purpose. For now, enjoy Episode Seven.

                    One of the first places I understood how these can coexist
                    together was on the soccer field. I knew this before meeting
                    Anand, but didn’t have the concepts or words to describe it
                    back then. So I think relating this soccer experience will
                    give a nice real world foundation for speaking about
                    personal power, peace, and our duty to use our power to
                    impact others.

                  <p>
                    A few minutes ago I totally schooled a guy on the opposing
                    team. Now I am dribbling with the ball and I see him coming
                    at me. I can tell he is on “tilt,” meaning that his emotions
                    have the better of him. I fake like I’m going to dribble
                    faster toward him and thus he takes the opportunity to slide
                    at me with vigor. But I had faked it, so as he slides at me,
                    I have time to jump over him and resume dribbling.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At this time in my soccer career I had been meditating for
                    three years, I had long hair, and I was known on the team as
                    the “spiritual guy.” This was very different than the high
                    school kid who was constantly yelling at referees, losing
                    his temper and being thrown out of games.{' '}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now, in college, it had become clear to me that the game was
                    a meditation: There were no winners or losers, there was
                    simply playing at the highest level and constantly evolving
                    and improving as players. I wasn’t beating anyone. I was
                    simply showing myself and others, by example, how to best
                    play. How to use all of the focus toward the ultimate goal
                    of playing at my maximum. How to watch the emotions, but not
                    fall prey to them. How to constantly be in awareness.
                  </p>

                    <strong>
                      Was I some nice, peacefully kind easy-going player?

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    No. If you watched from the outside, you would have seen an
                    absolutely tenacious, intense, and fierce man with a wavy
                    hairstyle akin to that of Brave Heart. So this is the
                    dynamic side. Yet inside I was still. Dynamic on the
                    outside. Peace inside. And then I was also expansive in my
                    continually learning, but humble as I got beat often and
                    quickly used it for the learning. At high-level athletics,
                    you recognize that when you think you have totally figured
                    out how to play, someone will come beat you and humble you
                    once more.

                      Soccer asked me to be at my utmost awareness of what was

                      internally.

                    If I acted peaceful on the outside but was raging on the
                    inside… I was simply not at peace. I was simply wasting
                    power. I realized following emotions was wasting the power I
                    could be using for the game. So the game asked me to harness
                    all my power for the goal and not waste it on expectations
                    and results. If you lost the ball? Simply adapt and now
                    defend. Force the other team to give it back to you. You
                    have no time to pout. I know, I know, many pros do pout, and
                    I really can’t believe it, honestly. Soccer asked me to be
                    still inside, but be incredibly dynamic on the outside;
                    using every facet of my body and senses amidst an
                    ever-changing field of 22 players constantly interacting.{' '}

                      I didn’t play soccer to get the feeling of winning.

                    I played for the enjoyment of playing and the enjoyment of
                    getting better at playing. And as I said, my
                    outlook/intention was to play at the highest ideal of the
                    game and I knew that would lead others to do the same. They
                    would then ultimately beat me and inspire me to see more and
                    grow. It was very clear to me then that we were all there to
                    show each other how to rise up - together.{' '}

                    When I recently told someone this, they said “You knew all
                    that at age 20? How?” I had read some books on meditation,
                    had practiced meditation on my own, and just easily saw how
                    it all applied in sports. Sports are simpler than life.
                    There is a lot less attachment to results in sports (if you
                    have perspective) than in life. It’s simply just a game…

                    <strong>
                      Firstly, I think more people have an experience of sports
                      than they do of motorcycling in the Himalayas with a guru.{' '}

                    This is also what motorcycling in the Himalayas asks of you,
                    perhaps you can see that now.{' '}

                    <strong>
                      Thirdly, to prep us to talk about this stillness and
                      peace, to make sure its sourced in true power, not a
                      facade based in conflict.{' '}

                      And lastly to show that as we step into our power, how we
                      are “being” will naturally lead others to that state.

                    This is where we finish the episode, with Anand calling on

                    In soccer, being in your power means totally schooling other
                    people, beating them, and scoring goal after goal… sometimes
                    pushing their emotional buttons too, until they realize to
                    not let them get the best of them. And we surely don’t let
                    someone beat us because we feel bad for them or don’t want
                    to hurt them. If they are unskillful, it becomes apparent
                    quickly. In life, it can be this simple, but often it’s more
                    complicated. These observations will all make sense in the
                    context of Ryan and Elle’s story of power, especially when
                    Ryan doesn’t stand up for himself… but first let’s talk
                    about peace and silence.

                        the greatest teachings I ever got was in that silence…
                        but silence of the mouth and the chattering of the mind,
                        is destructive. Then, it’s better you speak.

                    In Chapter Six we spoke about relationships. You will
                    remember that we must come to relationships empty, humble,
                    and ready to receive. We have to relate. Now, what if we are
                    not really empty inside, but are silent on the outside?
                    Anand calls it, “Silent of the mouth and chattering of the
                    mind.” In this case we are not at all receptive. So one
                    might look peaceful on the outside, but its what’s going on
                    inside that is important. It’s the peace inside that counts.{' '}

                    Ryan is a great example first of all because his deep
                    intention on this trip is to have peace in all aspects of
                    his life. It is a beautiful intention and most who watch
                    this show really resonate with him and his sincerity. Years
                    ago in Ryan’s past, he had hit rock bottom. Much like the
                    young soccer player I was, he would really lose his cool,
                    say very harsh things to people, blow his lid, and it got
                    him in a lot of trouble. So, he learned it was better to
                    bottle things up, stuff them down, and keep his mouth shut.
                    But at this point in our motorcycle journey, staying in this
                    protective cave of “quiet” on the outside and angry inside
                    will just not work anymore. It’s time for a quantum leap,
                    its time that the protective bubble must pop, even if it
                    served him for a long time.{' '}

                  <p>
                    The catalyst here on the journey was a moment at breakfast
                    when Elle started complaining about the food, talking about
                    how rich she is, and explaining that she didn’t need some
                    middle class fake experience of gratitude. Rather than say
                    anything, Ryan just bottled it, got up, and left. Rather
                    than say something that would offend or hurt someone, he
                    chose to internalize the violence… So there was really no
                    peace. And Elle’s toxic attitude still persisted at the
                    breakfast table. In essence the violence multiplied.{' '}

                      Peace and Spiritual Power do not “Look” a Certain Way.

                  <p>
                    This point is really important, because we, as people
                    seeking freedom, should not put spirituality or peace or
                    power into certain frameworks. They don’t have to “look” a
                    certain way. Peaceful people can run jump play, yell, stand
                    up for issues etc… In fact, before we rode toward Hemkund
                    Sahib and Valley of the Flowers, Anand reminded us that
                    peace is not just stillness. Peace (and Power) are both
                    Dynamic and Still at the same time.

                        To find stillness in dynamism is the key. That’s one of
                        the biggest arts we need in this world. Can stillness
                        and movement coexist. Expansion and humility. That’s how
                        nature is. Nature is never still, yet it is never
                        restless. Nature is powerful.

                    Nature is dynamic, always moving. But nature is still in
                    that it does not have any personal “drama” or
                    “restlessness.” I think it’s very important to know that our
                    freedom, our peace, and our power can have expression in
                    this world, in our lives. This isn’t a TV series about
                    meditating or withdrawing from life. What we are learning in
                    The Road To Dharma, and this online course, is practical
                    wisdom to apply into our lives, into this world. It must
                    integrate into our humanity and create more joy and freedom.{' '}

                    <strong>We often resist our power. Why? </strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Anand, when he heard of the breakfast time issue, asked Ryan
                    why he continues to not step into his power. Ryan says it’s
                    because he doesn’t want to hurt anyone. This is really a
                    cunning mind trick though. It appears to Ryan that he is
                    being a good guy by not hurting anyone, so he uses that
                    story to justify not stepping into his power. He can feel
                    like a ‘nice-guy’ savior or a martyr and thus never have to{' '}
                    <strong>accept and allow</strong> his real power, nor take
                    responsibility for it. The problem is that on some level he
                    knows this and internally there is conflict, there is no
                    peace, and he continues to avoid his{' '}
                    <strong>own truth, his dharma</strong>… and really,{' '}
                    <strong>his freedom</strong>. And again, on some level he
                    knows this, and this is why he is not at peace. This is why
                    he has come searching for peace… only to realize that{' '}
                    <strong>Peace Is Stepping Into Power</strong>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So Anand really gets clear with Ryan that the “I don’t want
                    to hurt anyone” is just a thought. It’s a thought that
                    clings onto the fear. Ryan is just afraid of his own power.
                    So it’s a convenient thought to attach to that fear.

                  <p class='mb-0'>
                    <strong>Ryan was not embracing his power.</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He wasn’t embracing this part of himself, because he also
                    had this story that he can’t handle the power. He had a
                    story that he needed to prove something in order to accept
                    that power. The truth is, we are the power already. We just
                    need to get out of the way and accept it. There is nothing
                    to prove. I’ll say it again, there is nothing to prove. You
                    must accept your power.{' '}

                    <strong>What is This Journey?</strong>
                    <br />
                    So here we were in the Himalayas, at 12,000ft, in the Hidden
                    Valley of the Flowers… and Elle was complaining about
                    breakfast… and Ryan was still caught in his story… So Anand
                    laid into the group in a fierce but compassionate way. He
                    very sternly reminded people what yoga is and isn’t and what
                    this Road To Dharma trip is and isn’t. I’d love to give the
                    simple version here. The long version you get to enjoy fully
                    in the bonus footage.
                  </p>
                  <p>This journey is not a tour.</p>
                  <p>
                    You cannot have a spiritual journey exist only in the little
                    box you want it in.{' '}
                  </p>
                  <p>Spirituality is not a product you can buy.</p>
                  <p>
                    Every experience is an opportunity to practice – To see how
                    we react.
                  </p>
                  <p>Watch what takes our attention when we are in the gap. </p>
                  <p>We are all strong enough now to not seek escape.</p>
                  <p>
                    Remember, none of this is personal, it is just states of
                    consciousness.
                  </p>
                  <p>You have to practice the teachings, the wisdom.</p>
                  <p>You must alter!</p>

                  <p>Magic only occurs outside of the bubble. </p>
                  <p>This is a journey for expansion, for transcendence.</p>

                    <strong>What is Yoga?</strong>
                    <br />
                    In this same talk in the Hidden Valley of the Flowers Anand
                    goes on to speak about Yoga. He basically says that the
                    journey we laid out above is Yoga. And that yoga is also
                    this:
                  </p>
                  <p>“Yogas Chitta Vritti Nirodha” </p>
                  <p>The cessation of self.</p>
                  <p>The transcendence of self.</p>
                  <p>Transcendence of the mind, </p>
                  <p>of its reactions,</p>
                  <p>of its agendas, </p>
                  <p>of its calculations, </p>
                  <p>of its expectations,</p>
                  <p>
                    the transcendence of the conditioned self… is the BEGINNING
                    OF YOGA.{' '}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>What is Dharma?</strong>
                    <br />
                    It can be many things. As we spoke of earlier in the course,
                    it is the truth, and it is the path to the truth. And here
                    we bring in that the Dharma is also our Duty. It is our
                    Responsibility. And I’ll say that it’s a natural
                    responsibility that occurs as one becomes more free.{' '}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So when Elle is in this toxic downward spiral it is our duty
                    to not engage in that progression with her. Pity and
                    Sympathy are not what we are looking to emulate. Pity
                    degrades and sympathy joins and expands the misery. They
                    both add to the pain. Compassion helps us evolve, but
                    sometimes compassion is fierce and abrupt. Compassion also
                    is like the “dance is the dancer”: We Don’t Really Have
                    Compassion - We Are Compassion. We must be whole and in our
                    power and thus in our being that… then we will help the
                    other rise. This is compassion. Compassion, like peace, does
                    not look a certain way. And Compassion is not to make
                    someone feel better. And that is partly why we use the quote
                    below in the title sequence for every episode. It is really
                    important to be reminded that your journey, your pilgrimage,
                    your life is not just about feeling better, you come here to
                    transcend.

                  <p>
                    So Dharma is our duty, our responsibility to ourselves to
                    transcend and to be the essence that helps others transcend
                    and evolve. And I am sure many might take this as carte
                    blanche to give others advice and teach them, but that’s not
                    what we are saying. The most important way to ‘do’ Dharma is
                    in your being. Thus, I’ll bring back the opening quote of
                    this chapter.

                    As Ryan showed us, stillness on the outside and conflict
                    within is not peace at all. It’s also not truly stepping
                    into power. Really stepping into ones power will bring about
                    peace, because we are no longer denying who we are.{' '}

                        Nature is a beautiful example of this. Very dynamic and
                        every growing, but still in its movements, it is never
                        restless.{' '}

                        actually must be humble, because humble is receptive.
                        Receptive is open to expand. And the most powerful thing
                        we know is ever expanding… the universe.{' '}

                    the Flowers and Hemkund Sahib, Elle gets bucked off her
                    horse. In that moment in the show she seems a bit triggered,
                    and that might have been so at the moment of being thrown
                    off. But after that, she tells the horse’s owner that if he
                    keeps hitting the horse, she is going to hit him. I love
                    this because in many ways she’s standing up for the animal,
                    and she’s also not willing to be part of the toxic behavior
                    of the horse owner. She has <strong>Perspective</strong> in
                    that she doesn’t just accept that horses being hit have to
                    be the way. She has <strong>Social Intelligence</strong> in
                    including an animal in her view of the world.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I suppose the irony is that later in the episode she is the
                    toxic one and Ryan fails to stand in his power. We’ll get to
                    her fall from grace, but for now see what you think of her
                    experience with the horse.

                    We’ll take the odd moment to point out how a character is
                    not using the positive virtues. We see what happens when we
                    fall out of our strength. In this case Elle would definitely
                    be in a space of <strong>Arrogance</strong>. Definitely
                    lacking <strong>Humility</strong> and thinking that her
                    previous experiences in life grant her the experience of “I
                    know.” This really cuts off the{' '}
                    <strong>Curiosity for Learning</strong> too and it’s really
                    shown through the fact that it’s coming through as anger. In
                    the interview with her, which is after the fact, she
                    recognizes it was a lot of the past all coming together at
                    that one moment. It wasn’t just the food!{' '}

                    Ryan, when confronted by Anand, shows his ability to listen
                    and ability to be <strong>Honest</strong> about what he is
                    going through. This helps Anand get real with him about
                    what’s true and what’s not. And Ryan now must{' '}
                    <strong>Persevere</strong>. He does so here, continuing to
                    contemplate and off-camera has a discussion with Elle. We
                    will see the realization he has in Episode 8 and then that
                    realization takes on a tangible form in Episode 9. I also
                    want to point out that Ryan is not only{' '}
                    <strong>Humble</strong> and <strong>Forgiving</strong> of
                    others, but is learning to <strong>Forgive</strong> himself.
                    In stepping into his power in the upcoming episodes, he is
                    in essence <strong>Forgiving</strong> himself for his deep
                    dark past. He need not be quiet and at “peace” in order to
                    “not hurt” people anymore. By stepping into his power now,
                    he is forgiving himself for past transgressions.

                    DHARMA WISDOM TALK by HIMALAYAN MASTER ANAND MEHROTRA
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                    In the bonus footage talk, we are here at the Hidden Valley
                    of the Flowers. With one sacred peak left, Anand takes the
                    opportunity to really remind everyone of why we come on
                    these journeys. It is not to feel better or to say that we
                    did it. We all come here to transcend. We are all deeply
                    committed and need to tap into that now. Yoga, Dharma,
                    Responsibility, Power, Nature…

                    MEDITATION/MANTRA: PERSONAL POWER{' '}
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                    We begin with the breath of fire, to empty ourselves. We
                    breath out more than in and thus are giving out more than
                    taking in. This creates a more empty self, empty of agenda
                    and empty of needing any “power over someone.” Then we bring
                    in Hat Hari Kriya #2, and this will balance us as well as
                    physically open the heart. Then we do the Ego Eradicator
                    kriya, which again further empties our agenda. Then Hat Hari
                    #3, which further balances us and opens the heart. Then
                    finally Agni Sara kriya, which develops a super strong sense
                    of true self. We have a tall spine and fierce pumping of the
                    belly with breath on its inhale retention and exhale
                    retention. So, we have a tall spine and soft heart.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We finish by bringing in a very powerful mantra, that is
                    also one of the Dali Lama’s favorite mantras.{' '}
                    <strong>OM TARE TUTARE TURE SO HA</strong>. It’s a mantra of
                    compassion – compassion is not pity or sympathy, it takes
                    you being deeply in your own power and radiating it. It is
                    beyond empathy. With our elevated frequency, we call and
                    invite you to rise up. Great for sending to people that are
                    going through tough times.
                  </p>
                  <p>

                    If you are really sincere about living a transcendent life,
                    a life of freedom, you need to lead wherever you are. This
                    is our duty; it is our dharma. Not only to ourselves but to
                    each and every one. Don’t underestimate how deeply you can
                    impact everybody’s journey just by the way you are being.
