                      Falling in love with the unknown and ending violence
                      within. How are those correlated and how does that lead to
                      freedom?
                    </strong>{' '}
                    Here in Chapter Four we build on the foundational wisdom
                    from Chapter Three; the death of the ego’s craving and
                    aversion. With this understanding in hand we now strengthen
                    the ability and importance to be with the unknown. Why?
                    Because we all have violence within. And that violence will
                    use situations and circumstances to rear its head and hijack
                    our lives, stealing the very freedom we have come here to
                    find. So we’ll develop this ability to be with the unknown,
                    expose the escape routes of the mind, expose the myth of
                    “choices”, see what this violence really is, and ultimately
                    find out that responsibility isn’t a burden, but the natural
                    affect of being free.{' '}

                      Tiffany, the escape we take in relationships, and he

                    <strong>Is dating like journeying into the unknown?</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What I’m about to relate is quite a lot for an opening
                    paragraph to this chapter. Why? Because it spans Chapter Six
                    (Relationships), Chapter Seven (True Power), and sets us up
                    for Chapter Five (Power in the Gap). But in the end, this
                    example from my life is to show us how we need to be with
                    the unknown, the unfamiliar, and the mystery. If we want
                    freedom in anything, this will be a step we must take. So
                    keep that in mind as I take you for a brief moment into my
                    dating life.{' '}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Very early in a relationship I had ignited a woman’s most
                    deep trigger and she was bringing up some of my most
                    unconscious patterns. We decided to take a pause and reflect
                    on ourselves. There were many things I realized during this
                    time, but one thing for sure was that I was in a power
                    struggle. Here we were, two people five dates in, not yet
                    committed to each other, and yet the control game was afoot
                    and we were basically adversaries. This is not good for
                    relationship, especially a very new one. So why would we be
                    in power struggle? Well we are both really smart people that
                    can make great arguments, but that’s not exact the reason.
                    We were actually just both triggered and when in that state
                    we will usually run to control the situation. Why control
                    the situation? Because we resist the circumstance and then
                    follow the Ego’s craving and aversion. And one way out of
                    the circumstance, is to control “things.” This is a form of
                    aversion.{' '}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>
                      But after some digging and observing myself I realized
                      that instead of needing to control I needed to surrender.
                    </strong>{' '}
                    What to surrender? I did not need to surrender to her. No,
                    that’s a form of control too, slipping into passively
                    letting other run the show. No. Surrender to what is
                    actually happening instead of resisting it. Surrender of my
                    agenda and goal for the relationship. Surrender of my vision
                    of relationship, which again would be my agenda. And then
                    really I needed to surrender to a new form of power. So the
                    power wouldn’t be over her or to get what I want. It’s a
                    different power that I wasn’t yet embodying. It’s a power
                    that’s not based on the results, but is based on
                    authenticity and truth. So, I dropped my agenda and began to
                    allow a power in that really isn’t easy to explain here. The
                    key concept is that I didn’t know what it would result in
                    and that the power wasn’t based in controlling life. The
                    power was based on being responsible for my reactions to
                    life. I needed to surrender to something that I didn’t
                    really understand and to something that also didn’t give me
                    control of the outer world. Otherwise I was going to stay
                    stuck in a conflict-based relationship fighting for a
                    different power, a power over her. I needed to be with the
                    circumstance, I needed to be observing the craving and
                    aversion and needed to watch the desire to escape all the
                    drama through manipulating it.{' '}
                    <strong>
                      And then, I needed to surrender to the unknown.

                  <p>
                    As mentioned, that is a lot for an opening paragraph and it
                    spans many chapters. And I don’t blame you if you don’t
                    grasp it all. But stay with me. A journey talking about the
                    unknown just might need to feel a little bit like wading
                    through the unknown, at times, while reading it. For now,
                    lets just focus on the fact that part of this process that
                    is “surrendering the known for the unknown.” Are you
                    familiar with how strangely hard it is to let go of the
                    known (safe, secure, familiar) even when it’s pure suffering
                    and pain? Do you know that we hold onto suffering because
                    its familiar, rather than to exchange it for the unknown…
                    because the unknown really feels that scary. But let me tell
                    you, upon deep inspection, its scarier to avoid the unknown,
                    because that means avoiding true freedom… and that is
                    something we all want.

                    When we control the circumstances, we are often denying that
                    it’s coming from craving and aversion. So first, like in
                    Chapter three, we need to take a pause to become aware of
                    what’s happing and allow ourselves to feel it. Difficult
                    circumstances will arrive in life, that’s a constant fact.
                    But most likely we will control the situation when this
                    occurs, and promptly take a different course to avoid
                    feeling it. We rarely are aware and allowing… Normally we
                    escape.{' '}
                  </p>
                  <p class='mb-0'>
                    <strong>
                      But deep down we know the violence is there.
                    </strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is key. I believe we know we are fooling our selves and
                    constantly running. And if we never slow down and look at
                    that, there is a bubbling violence waiting to happen. We
                    know that when push comes to shove, our inner violence will
                    come out and we will want to run, blame, and lash out at
                    whoever or whatever is in front of us: It could be a guru,
                    could be a girlfriend. Do we want freedom? Yes. And yet we
                    also know, deep down, that there is violence within us that
                    rarely gets unearthed. We also know its just waiting to lash
                    out. So we have this kind of inner conflict/violence that we
                    know is there, hiding… So because of that we know we aren’t
                    truly free. It is good to be honest about that. I’ll say it
                    again. Deep down, we know we are not free, hiding the inner
                    violence. So, when things do come up, lets be honest and
                    look at it when it occurs, rather than pretending we are
                    free. And what’s even better is if we consciously do things
                    that take us out of the comfort zone… because this will
                    expose the violence.{' '}

                  <p>
                    So, we are on the pilgrimage of The Road To Dharma, and the
                    riders and passengers are lashing out at Anand for having to
                    deal with wet blankets and not having sleeping bags. Can you
                    imagine that? A guru offers you a chance to come into the
                    sacred Himalayas on adventure to sites of power and freedom…
                    and you lash out at him because of sleeping bags? That is
                    some hidden violence for sure. It seems silly to even write
                    it, but it is what happened. The desire for freedom, which
                    we all committed to for three weeks on motorcycles in India,
                    was hijacked by the agenda of “I don’t want to be cold.”
                    That should blow our minds and reveal how much we are
                    ticking time bombs.{' '}

                    The one who is free won’t take any of it personally. Not the
                    circumstance. Not the other’s actions. Not the changes in
                    life that aren’t aligning with the agenda. Did Anand want a
                    bunch of people pissed at him in one of the most beautiful
                    places in the world? I doubt that was his ideal desire. I
                    doubt he wanted to deal with some very petty concerns of a
                    group of very privileged people… especially amidst a journey
                    where we see old women walking in flip flops in the cold, up
                    to 12,000ft… again, it seems ludicrous writing it now.{' '}

                      Anand didn’t take it personally and nor should we. But

                    Before I dig into that, I want to take a moment to

                    Anand says that the anger is not at him, he knows its not

                    This might sounds like a lot to grasp. It’s defiantly a big
                    leap. Try though. Grasp it. Let the reality of it set in.
                    It’s an even bigger leap to embody this quote. I am not
                    angry? Then what am I, what is knowing myself? What if it’s
                    something beyond my understanding? What if it means
                    embracing something unknown.{' '}

                      Embracing the unknown will catapult us beyond the world of

                    My anger towards her either. We just were not yet standing
                    in who we really are. To do that we needed to drop the
                    bullcrap. As Anand says, the stories we have will always
                    justify the triggered space. We will use the circumstances
                    of life also to justify the triggered space too. So my work
                    was to not let my trigger be justified by what was going on.
                    I also could not blame her for how I felt. That means we
                    have to allow the anger to actually be there and then
                    dissipate. So, it is very important to not take it
                    personally when we are angry or triggered. Who is angry
                    then? Well, lets at least know that its not the real “You”
                    or “I” or “Self.” It is simply a frequency. If we know it’s
                    not us, then we will garner more courage to step into the
                    unknown yet infinitely more potential “Self”.{' '}

                    We will dive specifically more into relationship in Chapter

                    making the jump into a new unknown way is actually the only

                  <p>
                    In Newtonian physics, we know that electrons don’t go
                    gradually from one echelon to another. The echelon is the
                    space (or world) in which the electrons orbit the nucleus.
                    They jump from being in one that’s close to neutron, to one
                    that’s suddenly bigger and farther away. And if I may then
                    jump to science fiction and outer space travel, it is very
                    clear that if we are to ever travel the universe (outside of
                    our solar system or galaxy) that we need to travel light
                    speed. But travelling at light speed will kill us.
                    Furthermore, even at light speed the distances to many other
                    solar systems and galaxies is thousands of years away.
                    Aaaah! Impossible. That’s why we need a concept like a
                    wormhole. This means we have to bend the context and
                    paradigm of Newtonian physics to travel, to have the
                    possibility and freedom to travel. And guess what happens?
                    We travel somewhere way faster than we could have imagined,
                    farther than we could have imagined, into the unknown.

                    <strong>Getting in Game Shape.</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A simpler example is the athlete. As a collegiate and
                    semi-pro soccer player I became familiar with getting in
                    “game shape.” A big part of arriving to that fitness level
                    is hard work and training the body. Another big part of that
                    is mental. What I mean specifically is that during a soccer
                    game I get to a point where I feel quite “tired”, but the
                    reality is that I can actually play in that state of “tired”
                    for another 20-30 minutes at a very high level. The mind and
                    body are screaming that we are tired, we must stop, its
                    going to hurt… and I say to myself, lets learn to play while
                    the body and mind are screaming… because “I” am not truly
                    tired. There are circumstances that are screaming at me. The
                    ego is freaking out and wants to leave. And we have to say,
                    well what if there is an unknown possibility here… maybe
                    this isn’t the edge of my fitness? Maybe the world isn’t
                    flat. And thus we keep playing amidst the feelings and soon
                    we see we don’t die. In fact we see we are so capable of
                    playing for a long time while “tired”. And we develop a
                    relationship with the body mind where we know that more is
                    possible than it wants us to realize. And so when we feel
                    tired, we are not bound by it. So a big part of being in
                    game shape isn’t that you never get tired, its learning to
                    play while tired, its learning to not freak out when the
                    body is tired, that we have more gears left. That is being
                    in game shape.{' '}
                    <strong>
                      So being in game shape for life means that when
                      circumstances feel dramatic or tiring, that we remain open
                      to a bigger, wider view… we might be more powerful than we
                      think, and their might be more to see or learn than we
                      realize… if we are willing to dive into the unknown.

                    And this example of athletes is directly proportional to the
                    motorcycle journey too. We are super tired after a hike down
                    Kedarnath, but only part of me is tired. Maybe it’s my legs
                    and my eyes. But not all of me is tired if I look at it
                    deeply. Those few sensations don’t get to rule my whole
                    perception of the motorcycle ride… and furthermore I have no
                    choice actually! I must ride. And if I don’t stay alert and
                    awake, I die. That surely helps us jump.{' '}

                    Escape is the main function that we spoke of in Ep3. It can
                    come in the form of blame like we see in Episode 4 with the
                    sleeping bag issue; people blamed Anand. But in general we
                    must realize humans will usually take escape route when its
                    there. We must start to see this pattern for ourselves in
                    our lives. Watch for the escape route we are taking. Can we
                    watch for that in every day life? Yes, of course. Might it
                    be easier if we take or dedicate some time, a weekend
                    retreat, adventure or set up something where we have no
                    escape routes? Yes, that would be very helpful. And that’s
                    why this modern world/society of so many choices, options
                    and money attained for the purpose of having choices and
                    options to avoid discomfort… HAS NOT LED US TO FREEDOM. This
                    is important to realize.{' '}

                    The society that creates an idea of freedom being “more
                    choice” has set up a false freedom that actually makes it
                    harder to find true freedom. How cunning it is that this
                    society we have created for ourselves keeps us from freedom
                    by making us think we are free?! It’s only creating more
                    escapes so that we never have to come to terms with things.
                    Come to terms with what things? With the circumstances, with
                    how things are, and ultimately exposing the violent thumb
                    that the Ego keeps us under in some false quest for its
                    outer freedom. And these escapes also keep us from coming to
                    terms with who we truly are. This is a big reason we suffer,
                    this escaping from the true longing we all share, which is
                    to realize who we truly are. This is a beautiful longing,
                    that we must remember to cultivate: Who am I truly!?
                    Mumukshutva, in Sanskrit, is this beautiful longing for the
                    truth of who we are, the truth that liberates us. This is a
                    longing we must keep stoking. It is not a fire we ever put
                    out and will ever keep revealing ourselves to our self.

                    In Chapter Four we are coming to terms with the violence
                    within and realizing that transcending it means being with
                    the unknown. This ability really sets us up for the power in
                    the gap at Tungnath of Chapter 5 (which revolves a lot
                    around Ken). This power that exists in between
                    words/thoughts and when we are in it we are more
                    responsible, more able to respond. The set up to that, here
                    in Episode 4, is that Ken (who is the rational minded
                    businessman that’s new to spirituality) speaks of how he is
                    mentally understanding that we have to take leaps of faith,
                    that we must leap into the unknown. He’s starting to see
                    what might be asked of him in action (in Episode 5) soon.
                    For now, he at least understands mentally that accepting the
                    unknown can be a big precursor to wisdom, to freedom. And
                    for a rational, super organized and put together
                    businessman, it is not easy. For Ken, being away from his
                    home turf (Malibu, California), being watched and lead by a
                    yogi, means Ken is less in control…

                    It’s for this reason also that Jeff and Jen are here. It

                    they have to look at their patterns and issues. Its really
                    forcing Jeff to take note of his wife and what’s going on
                    with them. And its forcing Jeff to see that people other
                    than Jen meditate, do yoga, and think like her. And Jeff
                    can’t escape to his work or escape into the drama of family
                    dynamics. Of course, Jeff does still escape at times on the
                    Road to Dharma. He literally leaves Jen and goes off on
                    adventure with Mario away from the group on Kedarnath after
                    the lake talk. And trust me, we’ll see more of this push and
                    pull from Jeff at the end of Episode 5… but Jen sees that
                    the power of having this trip with Anand will give their
                    relationship an element of “No Escape.” And by the end of
                    Episode Four she is feeling like her plan is working. I’m
                    not sure what “Plan is working” means, but I think it means
                    her goals are coming true… which could be something she’ll
                    need to let go of also... But nonetheless, it’s forcing the
                    issues and the “hidden violence within” to the surface.

                    Tiffany will be explored in the character virtues section in
                    more depths, but let us note that she gets super scared on
                    the motorcycle ride. Then instead of facing the fear, she
                    lets her mind take her off into a story. What’s her story?
                    That if she dies she’ll leave her kids motherless. She’s
                    feeling responsible for her kids. She’s thinking that the
                    more responsible thing to do is get off the bike and not
                    die! But this is so cunning of the mind. Instead of being
                    with the fear and being with the unknown, the mind has
                    created an escape route that sounds very justified, very
                    rational to her, and very rational to anyone watching the
                    show. Trigger uses circumstances to justify. Remember that
                    Anand said “When triggered (scared of dying) we will use any
                    circumstance to justify that trigger.” The trigger is being
                    scared of dying. The circumstance is that I am a mom. The
                    Justification is that I should be afraid, because I am a mom
                    and I am a “responsible” mom.{' '}

                    The truth though, is that Responsibility is the “Ability to
                    Respond.” It is what you do when you are free, you respond
                    to what is. Responsibility is not a burden. That isn’t
                    responsibility. So don’t say that we are “doing it for our
                    kid’s sake.” That is not true in this case. She was using
                    her kids to justify a fear. So watch out for this. Don’t put
                    that on your children or your partners. Do not blame them.
                    Yep, its blame.{' '}

                        It can happen to anyone at a different circumstance in
                        life. Where we give up our power and we blame. That’s
                        why we bring attention to it. Because its easy to not
                        bring attention to it.

                    Stepping into my power in relationship means not blaming,
                    not escaping, and thus bringing attention to all the
                    patterns that most cunningly try to take me out of my power.
                    Again, we will dive deeper into this power in Chapter Seven
                    with Ryan. But I hope we see how violent this inner conflict
                    is, how it robs us of our freedom, and how courageous we
                    must be to sniff it out. Don’t go believing that we are free
                    when we are not, the Ego is lurking, the practice must be
                    constant. I’ll give you a heightened practice at the end of
                    the chapter, a practice for surrender; Surrender of our POV,
                    so that we can see more, so we can sniff out violence.{' '}

                    resonates with us. Hopefully what resonates are their
                    virtues and strengths. Here is a reminder of the six major

                    MARIO’S NIGHT ON KEDARNATH:
                  </h5>
                  <ul>
                    <li>WISDOM AND KNOWLEDGE: Curiosity, Perspective</li>
                    <li>COURAGE: Bravery</li>
                    <li>TEMPERANCE: Self-Regulation, Humility.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    His night up on Kedarnath is an act of going into the
                    unknown, beyond his comfort zone. He awakens in the freezing
                    cold to a man walking in bare feet doing Morning Prayer.
                    Mario, meanwhile, is wrapped in two blankets and still
                    freezing. It is his <strong>Curiosity</strong> and{' '}
                    <strong>Bravery</strong> that yield him to a new{' '}
                    <strong>Perspective.</strong>{' '}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Knowing Mario personally before the trip, I know he is a bit
                    of an adventurer. And so for him doing something like that
                    isn’t all that crazy. But for him, the vision of the man in
                    bare feet at total ease, or the vision of the old woman in
                    flip flops hiking… it humbles him. Mario chose this
                    adventurous nighttime “test,”, but these people live it
                    daily and are at ease. It’s powerful to see. It’s that thing
                    that occurs in you while in India after some time: You see
                    people live a different way, a more reverent way for sacred
                    sites and for sacred wisdom… Then it sets in that the
                    culture seems to have a respect for history and for the
                    lineage of time in general. You are faced with thousands of
                    years of civilization all around you. It becomes palpable
                    that this world existed before you and will go on much after
                    you die.{' '}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, jumping into the fray, challenging oneself, and then
                    with continual practice, will yield the{' '}
                    <strong>Perspective.</strong> It <strong>Humbles</strong>{' '}
                    Mario to see others that live there with such sacred lives,
                    no doubt reflecting on his own back in Michigan. So making
                    his side adventure took <strong>Curiosity</strong> and{' '}
                    <strong>Bravery</strong> on his part…{' '}
                    <strong>the reward is Perspective.</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We then see Mario, during the moto ride away from Kedarnath,
                    take a bad fall, flipping over his handlebars. The beauty
                    was that earlier that day he told Anna not to ride on the
                    back of his bike. He just felt he was tired and wanted to
                    get his bearings and lo and behold he had the accident. So,
                    it was great <strong>Self Regulation</strong> when he told
                    her not to ride on the back of his bike. He had to drop the
                    ego, not be afraid to look “weak”, and to trust his
                    intuition. Then after the accident he again had to remember
                    to come back to his mantra of “slow and steady,” to remember
                    to keep listening to his inner voice.

                    FRED GETS THE FEELING BACK:
                  </h5>

                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Fred really is showing the virtues of{' '}
                    <strong>Perseverance</strong> and{' '}
                    <strong>Spirituality</strong>. He keeps getting back on this
                    bike fall after fall. It’s kind of amazing. And, on this
                    ride he really steps into this spiritual place of really
                    making his mind up that he will not fall anymore. He{' '}
                    <strong>Transcends</strong> the physical and mental in many
                    ways.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At the tea stop we see that Fred is very loved, accepted,
                    and taken care of by the group. In the healing world, we
                    know that having people check on you, care, love you, all
                    help you heal from illness. In the spiritual world, having
                    community that supports your quantum leaps and your growth
                    is so helpful for spiritual healing/growth. The group
                    recognizes Fred’s courage and much like you the audience, is
                    really pulling for him on all levels. The group shows{' '}
                    <strong>Teamwork,</strong> which is a form of{' '}
                    <strong>Justice,</strong> by including and encouraging him.
                    They show <strong>Love and Kindness</strong> by making space
                    at the lunch table, noticing him and his growth, and
                    speaking that out loud to him. They even clap for him. And
                    Anand of course is simply always there to support Fred’s
                    intention. He is there with a hug a smile, and his constant{' '}
                    <strong>Leadership. </strong>

                  <p>
                    She thought she was going to die for 40 minutes on the muddy
                    ride after Kedarnath. That fear is then warped into some
                    idea that she is being irresponsible as a mother. As
                    mentioned earlier, this is great example of the cunning
                    violence within. The subtle mind/story puts us into this
                    conflict in the mind “Do I stay on bike or not?” I am afraid
                    of dying and leaving the kids motherless… this makes the
                    initial fear of death now even more scary… potentially
                    justifying an escape.
                  </p>

                    {' '}
                    In the end though she continued on the bike. She had 40
                    minutes of difficult fears but she continued. The real
                    beauty of this section is she shows the cunning nature of
                    the mind, of the stories, and of the violence within… the
                    violence of blame rather than being with what is. She is
                    literally blaming her child. It spurs Anand to talk about
                    this and we’ll see that whole talk in the bonus footage. For
                    now, check out the Tiffany moment and Anand’s condensed
                    wisdom.{' '}

                  <p>
                    Using Tiffany’s issue with her children as a lift off point,
                    Anand takes us deeper into Escape and Blame and Embracing
                    the Unknown. You’ll see he uses the idea of relationship to
                    do this. He is speaking about relationship in general, not
                    just romantic. We’ll dive deeper into romantic relationships
                    in Episode 6 using Jeff and Jen as the catalyst.{' '}

                    MEDITATION/MANTRA: TRANSCEND INTO THE UNKNOWN.{' '}
                  </h5>

                  <p>
                    In this meditation I will first balance us with the Alom
                    Vilom breath. Then stabilize the nervous system with the
                    Prana Apana kriya. Then bring in the 4-part breath. This
                    will all really alleviate anxiety and worry, stabilize our
                    nervous system, and prepare us to be with this vastness that
                    is constantly loving us. We stabilize so that we can more
                    easily accept and access the power of the mantra Ahum Prema,
                    I am Love.{' '}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>AHAM PREMA </strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>(Ah Hum Prey Mah)</p>
                  <p>
                    Aham Prema is basically saying “I am Love.” Let me be clear
                    that its not that “I have love” or “I love you.” It is “I AM
                    Love.” By the very nature that I exist, constantly full of
                    molecules and atoms that are coming into existence, birthing
                    into life at every moment; I am Love. I am love in its very
                    nature because I am that which makes up the universe, and
                    that is love too. It’s a very simple and easy mantra so you
                    can easily let it vibrate all through every cell so your
                    entire body-mind gets it without translation. Embody it. Try
                    it on, see what happens. I love to use this at the end of a
                    meditation to really open myself up, to really embrace the
                    love that I am.{' '}
