                    In Episode 8 we hike up the last sacred peak, our highest
                    peak, to Hemkund Sahib for a dip in sacred freezing waters
                    at 15,200ft. This Sikh temple is about community, unity, and
                    purpose. In this Chapter we see that as we become free, we
                    realize that we have more desire and energy to serve the
                    community. And{' '}

                      as we serve others, our true purpose becomes clearer.

                    This isn’t something someone can tell you, because the true
                    calling,{' '}

                    And that’s what Hemkund Sahib is all about.

                    What are the obstacles keeping us from purpose? Usually it’s
                    the craving of external happiness. In the morning of the
                    hike up Hemkund, Anand informally talks with some of the
                    group about fake freedom: sex, power, money, fame. He
                    relates an amazing story of his own father’s loss and as
                    well as his father’s insistence on living with principles.
                    We’ll go deeper into principles in Chapter Nine. For now

                    CHAPTER EIGHT: FINDING FREEDOM IN PURPOSE
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                    This example will pertain to unity and purpose but it starts
                    in physics… back when I was 17 years old.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At the end of high school I had stumbled into the book
                    “Ageless Body Timeless Mind,” which was the first book I had
                    read that fused quantum physics with this thing called
                    spirit or consciousness. Needless to say it made me a fan of
                    the author, Dr. Deepak Chopra, right away. My science/math
                    brain was super engaged, pleased, and pleasantly distracted
                    while something else was slowly edging its way into my
                    consciousness.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By freshman year in college I was explaining to many of my
                    friends what quantum physics was and how to let it into our
                    lives in a fun practical way. I’d tell them to look at their
                    hand, then see the skin, then imagine the tissue, the cells
                    of that tissue, the molecules, and now the atoms. Inside the
                    atom is a nucleus made up of a proton and neutron (in
                    general) and then some amount of electrons spinning around
                    it. The key was that 99.9999999999999% of the atom was
                    space. So really we are mostly space. And what’s in that
                    space? Well, that’s the quantum field and this is where…
                    well, this is where thought travels… and it travels at
                    speeds faster than light. In fact, the communication from
                    here to anywhere in the universe is virtually instantaneous.
                    And, it’s all connected. So, I’d say to them, we are all
                    space. I’d say there is really nothing between us. I’d say
                    that we are all connected. And my thoughts are known
                    everywhere in every instant. So I can send you a thought, or
                    rather put a thought into the quantum field, and it will
                    have an affect.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>
                      In 1994 this correlation of quantum physics and
                      spirituality was more groundbreaking. You probably all
                      know this by now.
                    </strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After I had had that discussion with most friends, it was
                    like we were eerily connected from then on. I remember in
                    one physics class, ironically, I decided to just mentally
                    send a thought that “I wanted to see my friend Lauren.” Mind
                    you, I’m in a 200-person lecture hall on a 20,000-person
                    campus and Lauren is not in these engineering buildings,
                    she’s an English major. But, ten minutes later, she stops at
                    the door, and looks in. The next time I saw her, I asked why
                    she had come there and looked in… “No reason, was just
                    passing through the building to go quicker through campus
                    and felt like looking into that room,” she said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I tell this story for two reasons. First, it sets us up for
                    understanding this concept of unity and greater connection
                    to something that unifies us all. This knowingness, that we
                    are connected, seems essential to finding a purpose that’s
                    beyond just “my purpose, my life.” Secondly, it shows that
                    the concept of quantum physics or a unified field had
                    application beyond a concept. And that application over time
                    and with practice, did change the way I saw and interacted
                    with the world (and my friends.) I altered, even if only
                    slightly. My worldview changed. I knew then that we have an
                    effect on the world/each other in a way that’s beyond my
                    understanding of time and space. So, I could not go back to
                    a time when I thought Newton had it all figured out… Dare I
                    say it? “We can never go back to high school, man.”

                        One of the biggest problems with humanity is that they
                        think they are free while they are enslaved. They create
                        an illusion in their mind that they are free, while they
                        walk around enslaved by their own small self.{' '}

                    I’ve written it both ways, trying to see which is best, but
                    they are both intertwined.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Finding purpose may come to us as we discover more freedom.
                    And living with purpose may lead to more freedom. In
                    discussing purpose, we will explore the idea of truly
                    altering, we will explore the surrender of the “what about
                    me,” and we will look at the obstacles to true purpose. Then
                    we will bring that into an understanding of community and
                    substantiate it with this physics-proven connectedness.
                    Then, we will come back to Anand’s father and see how this
                    new view, and how a purpose to serve, works within the
                    principle of abundance. That also will take us to the end of
                    the chapter for a special bonus talk from Anand on the story
                    of Saraswati and Lakshmi, a story of true abundance.{' '}

                  <p>
                    As we relinquish our constant need to satisfy the small “I”
                    and as we apply all we are learning in this course, we may
                    find a natural desire to serve. One could look at the Buddha
                    or Jesus and realize that once these masters were free, they
                    did not leave. What did they do? They helped others find
                    liberation. Of course, not all free beings are becoming the
                    second coming of Christ, as there are many ways to serve.
                    Purpose does not “look” a certain way, just as freedom does
                    not. Serving ice cream can be one’s purpose for some time.
                    Lets not overthink what freedom, purpose and serving may
                    look like.

                  <p>
                    Also we may find freedom by first jumping into purpose. In
                    general this really is one path to true yoga, through
                    devotion and service. So one might not be free yet, but one
                    knows to engage in acts of service, in doing things that
                    serve beyond themselves. When practiced and applied over and
                    over, then the conditioned mind that serves the small “I”
                    starts to weaken and we grow a new muscle that is much more
                    expansive, inclusive, and free of our petty longings. One
                    could say that by serving others, by really diving into ones
                    true purpose of transcending little “I”, the byproduct
                    becomes freedom.

                    <strong>Finding Purpose – We must alter Deeply.</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Anand’s quote is so incredibly clear, that I don’t have too
                    much to add. His words really stop me in my tracks. His
                    words remind me that there is a tendency on the spiritual
                    path to understand a concept and then think we have it
                    mastered. But if it doesn’t really alter all the above, my
                    perception and my behavior, then it has not quite sunk in
                    yet. And guess what, that’s ok. But lets be honest about it.
                    Some teachings started sinking into me at the end of The
                    Road to Dharma pilgrimage and some have taken many years to
                    really set in deeply. You’ll see events in Episode Nine and
                    Ten that led to the beginning of this altering in me that I
                    must admit is still really taking hold in everyday life for
                    me.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In traditional Yoga Terminology, in order to alter ourselves
                    deeply, we must have Shavana Manana Antharakarna. Hear the
                    teachings (Shavana), deeply inquire about the teachings
                    (Manana), and then have profound experience of the teachings
                    (Antharkarna).

                  <p>
                    The main thing would be to surrender the constant idea of
                    “What about me.” We’ve talked about this in Chapter Three,
                    The Death of Ego. But we also started to see how cunning the
                    ego could be at the end of Episode 7 with Ryan’s excuse of
                    “not wanting to hurt people.” Here in Episode 8, Ryan’s
                    worldview has definitely altered. He will never forget this
                    experience with Anand in the Himalayas, where Anand ‘set him
                    straight’. He has been firmly shown that he must step into
                    his power and cannot fall into the fear of failure, which he
                    is masking with ‘the fear of hurting others’. Ryan expresses
                    this realization, here in Episode Eight, that he is the
                    power, that he already has it… and that he doesn’t have to
                    find it or prove it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>
                      But what I also find beautiful, is that Ryan also realizes
                      that there is some integration of that stepping into one’s
                      power still needing to occur.
                    </strong>{' '}
                    No doubt he knows it, but he will need to continue to
                    experience and apply it for some time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I also love that fact that Ryan cannot truly be of service
                    to others until he really steps into his own power. I love
                    this. Why? Because his previous “service to others” was this
                    idea of “not hurting them.” But this truly isn’t serving
                    anyone; in fact it was causing more suffering. His view on
                    service has changed forever... now his view is tied to his
                    own freedom and true power.{' '}
                    <strong>
                      Yet he will need to continually step into this power,
                      accepting his true power.
                    </strong>{' '}
                    It’s not a done deal just because the concept rings true.
                    And this realization is a great lead-in to talk about the
                    obstacles to our true purpose.{' '}

                    <strong>Finding Purpose – The four main obstacles</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>Money, Power, Fame, Sex.</p>
                  <p>
                    There. Now go make a religion that says no money, no power,
                    no fame, no sex. And finally you will find a group of people
                    totally free! Or… perhaps just knowing these concepts really
                    amounts to nothing. Why? Because rules can easily become
                    reduced to dogma and fanaticism. Any tools can be corrupted.
                    So, lets inquire a bit into these topics and what Anand
                    shared with us about these phenomena at the breakfast table
                    before the hike up Hemkund Sahib. You know, just your normal
                    morning discussion when on a pilgrimage with a guru…
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What Anand refers to in the breakfast talk is that one needs
                    to know oneself and ones identity outside of these things
                    (money, power, fame, sex.) It’s quite clear in America that
                    we falsely have been taught, especially as males, to
                    identify with money. Money gives us power to provide. Power
                    to provide gives us power to ‘get the woman’. Fame gives
                    money and power and thus perceived power to acquire sex.
                  </p>
                  <p class='mb-0'>
                    <strong>Money is the big one.</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The pursuit of money-power-fame-sex is engrained in us. And
                    many people define themselves based on how well they are
                    doing in this pursuit. But if we want to be free, we have to
                    know ourselves independently of money, power, fame, sex. In
                    Chapter Two I relayed how I was broke, without job, home and
                    incapacitated, post knee surgery. Identity based on money,
                    power, fame, sex… would tell me that I was not worth much,
                    or anything at all.

                        The moment you think of money, you have lost. You have
                        lost your power to a man-made entity. Think instead of
                        how it (your action/behavior) might help, how it will
                        make others feel, the impact on the world. Think on the
                        energetic level.

                    Yes, think of how we are serving and liberating others with
                    the things we do. Think of the energy that comes with that.
                    When you envision and feel what the impact of your action
                    and behavior is, there is energy behind and within that.
                    This is powerful. If we look at the Road to Dharma journey,
                    do you think people chose to come on it to make money? For
                    most I would say it was them thinking of how they could be
                    more free, how to become better people for those in their
                    lives… Did some want fame? As you see in the opening of
                    Episode One, everyone paid for their own journey and we did
                    not announce that we were going to film the journey until
                    three weeks before it started. So for the most part people
                    were here for a journey, not to be in a show.{' '}

                    On the hike up to Hemkund Sahib, we were instructed to chant
                    the mantra “Wahe Guru, Wahe Guru,” which is honoring the
                    true guru within you. It’s calling on that inner knowing,
                    inside of you. To me, that inner guru, is the “knowing” that
                    is connected to all, not separated as the needy individual.
                    It is the part of us which is in Unity with it all, and
                    which can really best guide us to serve the whole, and
                    thereby liberate ourselves.

                    When we looked deeply inside our cells and atoms, we saw
                    space. This space is a unifying field in which things
                    communicate at speeds that defy normal time and space
                    boundaries. So I find it fascinating that we don’t have to
                    look outward and connect to everything outside of us to find
                    unity. For some people, that “connecting to everything” can
                    feel really difficult. They wonder, “How do I connect to all
                    things, all planets, beings?” So I say don’t worry about
                    that. Let us instead look inside and at the inner most
                    places. Look into where we are part of this space, (or
                    rather this space is part of and inside of us) this field
                    where things all communicate. It is here that we are thus
                    unified. Just go into this space and see how it feels. It is
                    strange, but as we go in between the smallest “things” we
                    actually are connected to the greatest vastness. And it is
                    here, in between (in the gap), that I can think of someone
                    in college … and they walk into the room… it is also here
                    that you start to realize that you cannot hide from anyone
                    or anything, because it’s all connected. Sorry, God really
                    is watching.

                    The part of us that is in unity with it all is not concerned
                    about the “what about me?” This part can help you answer
                    that question, “How can I serve? What’s’ my purpose?” It
                    can’t come from the desire for false power, from those
                    actual obstacles. If we identify with the greater whole,
                    then we may get a clearer picture of purpose. This takes
                    courage of course… but courage has been an ongoing theme in
                    this course and if you are here in Chapter Eight, you

                    So as we come back to that quote, let us elude to Chapter
                    Nine where we will explore guiding principles that help us
                    stay in tune with our Unity. The principles that help us
                    embrace this notion of connection and put it into the real
                    experience of living. The principles that really deepen our
                    experience of freedom. Principles are key to living in
                    freedom. Why? Because a Principle is founded on The Whole,
                    not a pathetic little ego.

                  <p>
                    <strong>One of the principles is of abundance.</strong> We
                    spoke already of not succumbing to the man made notion of
                    money and instead looking at Energy. We then must also start
                    to view the idea of abundance in a new way – life-energy is
                    not about money – because life-energy is far greater than
                    money, a mere a man-made object. Abundance is a Way Of
                    Living. It is a Deep Knowing and Fearlessness that comes
                    with Non-Identification with the small self‘s ever changing
                    and unstable material role-play.{' '}

                    <strong>The Purpose Triangle</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a recent deep dive master’s training taught by Anand, he
                    discussed the purpose triangle. I want to share some of what
                    I learned there as its very insightful for giving context to
                    the idea of purpose. You see, often we think of purpose as
                    just “what am I here to do in life,” like what’s my career
                    or form of service? But that’s only part of the equation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There are three sides and points to a triangle and thus
                    three parts of the purpose triangle. Our individual purpose,
                    the shifting purpose, and the greater purpose or calling.
                    The first is quite simple and to the point. The individual
                    purpose is to evolve and grow. You have come here into this
                    form to evolve and grow. So, we can look at any challenge or
                    anything in life as an opportunity to evolve oneself.{' '}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Then the second aspect, the shifting purpose, is the purpose
                    that is defined by whatever is being asked of you in the
                    moment. So that could be stepping in to help someone in
                    need, could be to offer advice, to save the dog in the
                    street, or to simply give a grounded look of security and
                    compassion to someone having a tough day. It shifts based on
                    what the moment is calling for. And, we are aware enough to
                    know what we are being called to do in the moment. But we
                    don’t create the idea that what I am here to do in the world
                    is help every person across the street or save every dog
                    etc…
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This leads us to the third aspect, the greater purpose or
                    calling for humanity. We will all have a purpose that will
                    serve the greater humanity; in essence we are bringing
                    something to society or our smaller tribe that is helpful to
                    our greater community. Often, we get too caught up in
                    knowing this third aspect of purpose. People think that we
                    must find this main controlling idea of “calling” in order
                    to be whole… It is third for a reason, without the personal
                    evolution and the shifting purpose, then we might get lost
                    in our need for a greater calling or lost in the idea of
                    this purpose and thus loose site of our own evolution or the
                    thing right in front of us that needs our help. The Buddha
                    often said that you should not walk by your hungry or
                    hurting brother en route to even meditation. The shifting
                    purpose is right there in front of you…Another example would
                    be to justify stressing out about a project which you feel
                    is there to help serve humanity. We put aside our personal
                    evolution for the story of “saving” the whole.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, think on this, and watch for it in your life. See if you
                    see this distinction and find the purpose triangle useful.

                    CHARACTER VIRTUES & SPECIFIC MOMENTS WE SEE THE TEACHINGS
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                    When we watch stories on television, we empathize with
                    characters. We feel scared with them, we hope for redemption
                    for them, we cheer for them, and something about them
                    resonates with us. Hopefully what resonates are their
                    virtues and strengths. Here is a reminder of the six major
                    virtues and their sub virtues.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>COURAGE: </strong>Bravery, Honesty, Perseverance,
                    Zest.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>HUMANITY: </strong>Love, Kindness, Social
                    Intelligence
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>WISDOM & KNOWLEDGE: </strong>Creativity, Curiosity,
                    Judgment, Love of Learning, Perspective
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>TRANSCENDENCE: </strong>Gratitude, Hope, Humor,
                    Spirituality, Appreciation
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>JUSTICE: </strong>Teamwork, Fairness, Leadership
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    *I personally like the word Inclusivity, which I feel falls
                    in Teamwork and Fairness.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>TEMPERANCE: </strong>Forgiveness, Humility,
                    Prudence, Self-Regulation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These are also qualities to reinforce and that give us
                    greater access to freedom. Let’s see how the characters
                    embodied this (or didn’t.) and how it brings to light the
                    wisdoms and realizations of the episode. Also note that for
                    your ease, we have included the specific clips from the
                    episode, so you can easily watch the section again without

                    JEN MEETS VIOLENCE WITH LOVE

                  <p>TEMPERANCE: Forgiveness</p>
                  <p>
                    Leaving the Hidden Valley of the Flowers, Jen is discovering
                    insights about her family. Normally there is a lot of
                    violence there, yelling, arguing, and screaming. One big
                    question from her at the beginning of Episode Seven is why
                    the father doesn’t step in and do something about it. But
                    now here in Episode Eight, she is taking responsibility for
                    how she meets that violence, knowing that she can meet it
                    with <strong>Love</strong>. That takes a level of{' '}
                    <strong>Forgiveness</strong> and it takes a lot of{' '}
                    <strong>Transcendence</strong>. Transcendence of what? Well,
                    first of all transcending the “What about me?” And then
                    allowing this idea that we are responsible, that we are the
                    power, and that the power is not over another. There is no
                    winning of the fight, as we are all truly connected… so be
                    the solution! Step into <strong>Love</strong>. And I think
                    that is a great starting point, to make sure she is in a
                    connected place and can thus see her whole family, and
                    what’s hurting them all, rather than mainly being concerned
                    just about what’s hurting in her. Now, there is a
                    possibility, a hope for solution. Nobody is saying to lie
                    down and get walked over. Not at all. In fact Anand finishes
                    this episode by saying that a true warrior has a strong
                    spine and a soft heart. We’ll dive deeper into that in
                    Chapter Nine.

                      she has to go up this last hike, but she just doesn’t want
                      to do another hike. The little girl inside of her is kind
                      of “over it.” But, she knows better, and straps up the
                      hiking boots and furthermore drops into the mantra Anand
                      instructed us to use: “Wahe guru, wahe guru,” calling upon
                      the guru within. And she even adds English to the mantra
                      saying “Walk with purpose, walk with purpose.” What she
                      finds is that she is flying up the mountain with great
                      ease, she is seeing the joy of the people and community.
                      She is <strong>Appreciating</strong> the hike, the sacred
                      nature of things, and <strong>Appreciating</strong> the
                      power of mantra
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Sometimes we need to just dig in and do the “work” even
                      when we don’t feel like it. <strong>Perseverance</strong>{' '}
                      is <strong>Courage</strong>. So keep going. It’s Chapter
                      Eight… it’s not about finishing, and it’s also not about
                      just feeling great while working through this course
                      either. <strong>Persevere</strong>, keep reading,
                      inquiring and applying these teachings. We’ve now arrived
                      at the top of the fourth peak and there are only two more
                      chapters to go…

                      DHARMA WISDOM TALK by HIMALAYAN MASTER ANAND MEHROTRA
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                      In the bonus footage talk, we are at a small jungle
                      temple. Anand tells us the sweet and simple story of
                      Saraswati and Lakshmi. It helps us understand true
                      abundance. I feel it also helps us understand that we
                      aren’t praying to these “gods” for things or for wealth.
                      To me its all metaphor that helps us understand ourselves,
                      its not an explanation of what gods and goddesses exist
                      and how the hierarchy of the world and heavens function.

                      <li>What the true master yogi Shiva seeks</li>
                      <li>What is the true abundance</li>

                      MEDITATION/MANTRA: INNER CLARITY
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                      In this meditation we will create a sense of inner clarity
                      – the teacher within. We begin with the spinal breath,
                      which really opens up the heart/chest physically and
                      energetically. Then we balance the energy with Alom Vilom.
                      And then bring in Prana Shakti to really heighten the
                      energy while cleansing before we bring in the powerful
                      mantra Om Namo Gure Dev Namo. In this mantra we are
                      calling upon our highest consciousness, the divine teacher
                      within.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>OM NAMO GURU DEV NAMO</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>(OM Nah-Mo Guru-Dayv Nah-Mo)</p>

                    whole trip.
