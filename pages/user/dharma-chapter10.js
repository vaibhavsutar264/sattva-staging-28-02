                    Life is greater than our expectations, thankfully so. That
                    if life turned out the way human beings thought it would, we
                    would be in big trouble. People would be falling off the
                    edges, because they expected that if you walk far enough you
                    would fall of the edge of the earth.{' '}

                  <p>
                    In Episode 10, two of the riders get a wake-up call in the
                    form of fear, panic, and a near death experience. For me, it
                    is a reminder of how sacred life can be. So we’ll explore
                    this concept of <b>Sacred</b> in more detail in Chapter Ten,
                    while we reveal to you the depths of what really occurred
                    that day in the Ganga River. From there, we’ll be reminded
                    how to reveal that you are <b>Greater Than You Know.</b> We
                    learn how to create space for life and ourselves to be
                    beyond what we think, beyond our little bubble-like
                    limitations.{' '}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We also circle back to the challenges and intentions that
                    brought the many different characters on this journey,
                    revisiting them to see if their arching lessons are over or
                    just beginning. So this chapter is partly a summary of the
                    freedom we have found, partly some important takeaways, and
                    in the end it is a reminder that until we take
                    responsibility for our freedom… nothing changes. Freedom is
                    our choice, but it is a choice that takes great courage and
                    commitment and takes nothing short of your complete
                    totality!{' '}

                    is about – you are greater than you know, you are more
                    capable than you know, you are more powerful than you have
                    been lead to believe. Choose freedom – and you will realize

                    CHAPTER TEN: FREEDOM OF EXPANSION – WE ARE GREATER THAN WE
                    KNOW
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                    Well, we have arrived at the last chapter, the last episode
                    of the series. But by now you realize that the journey is
                    ever growing and changing, so the course reflects that too.
                    Here, in this last chapter, I break the mold a bit in this
                    opening paragraph. Instead of relating a past experience
                    separate from The Road To Dharma, I will take this
                    opportunity to reveal details and insights from my
                    experience in the Ganga River, insights that were not
                    expressed fully in the show. Relating the detailed emotions,
                    rational thoughts, circumstances, and lessons will help us
                    dive deeper (couldn’t resist the pun) into the wisdoms of
                    this Chapter.

                    <strong>Panic. Fear. Where did it come from?</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The answer is two fold. Part of it was in me, and part of it
                    was picked up from those around me in the River.{' '}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>
                      The Ganga River doesn’t look all that treacherous at this
                      point in the episode.
                    </strong>{' '}
                    It almost looks calm in that section of the river where we
                    decided to swim across. Then, once we are in and swimming,
                    you see just how quickly we are moving down river. The main
                    concern in my mind was getting across the river fast enough
                    so that we wouldn’t get pulled farther down the Ganga where
                    it gets even faster, is rocky, and full of rapids. Once you
                    are at that rapid, rocky point, it’s kind of a “done deal.”
                    Many people die in that area every year, even from just
                    swimming near the shore and then getting pulled into the
                    current… never to be seen again.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, the key is to get to the other side fast so you don’t
                    get pulled down river into the rapids. As soon as I was in
                    the water, I swam hard, like a full sprint freestyle stroke.
                    Even with the rush of excitement, you are keenly aware of
                    the frigid temperature of the waters; this is Himalayan snow
                    recently turned water. Super cold. We are swimming fast and
                    in my sprint I look up and realize I’m nearly to the other
                    side already. I poke my head from the water to see a bunch
                    of big rocks, rocks which I would learn later are littered
                    with signs that say “Dangerous currents, don’t swim!” I give
                    it one last burst to get to the rocks, then suddenly I am
                    whipped away from the shore, and now am 10 yards away again…
                    “What happened?” I thought, as I was being pulled away, down
                    and around… “What’s happening!” I then thought. I push
                    again, and again I’m spun back out and around. I look up
                    again through the half-blinded vision of rapids splashing in
                    my eyes, and I see Jeff…
                  </p>
                  <p class='mb-0'>
                    <strong>
                      Jeff is panicking. Waving his arms. Yelling for help.{' '}
                    </strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Oh shit, are we in big trouble?” I thought. I’m relaying my
                    thoughts to you because it will show you that I am thinking
                    rationally during the experience, but ultimately I will
                    react from fear. Both can happen (fear and rational thought)
                    and this is important to keep in mind as you read. “Jeff was
                    first to swim, now he’s in trouble. Where’s Anand? I think
                    that’s him down river, but not across. Nobody is across.
                    Nobody is across yet?! Oh shit. Are we all screwed here?”

                    <strong>Key Moment</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In retrospect I realize that it is at this moment that I
                    took on Jeff’s fear. Yes, the fear had to first be present
                    inside me before I could take it on, that’s true. So I’m not
                    saying he “gave” it to me. I had the fear swelling up, but I
                    had a choice to give in to it or rise above it. Jeff’s fear
                    amplified my own, and I allowed it. Does that make sense?
                    Seeing someone else’s panic somehow amplified my fear,
                    justified my fear, made it more real and believable. So
                    Jeff’s panic justified and amplified my own.{' '}
                  </p>
                  <p class='mb-0'>
                    <strong>
                      Could I have looked at Jeff with calm, clear eyes?
                    </strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Yes. I could have reacted differently and calmed him,
                    absolutely. I’m not saying it would have worked on him, but
                    my experience would have been different. But as I said, even
                    in this cycle of fear I did not lose my rational mind…{' '}

                    I remember Anand said that if you get in trouble in the
                    Ganga, just float. So I paused and floated. But when I would
                    float, the Ganga pulled me down under. “Holy shit! That
                    doesn’t work. I need to use all my energy just to even stay
                    above water.” So again, I am thinking and processing, but
                    now the “tool” of floating is not working. Fear is growing,
                    but I’m not like “horror film panicking” and dropping my car
                    keys while a ghost is chasing me or something… And this is
                    really important to note, this is the setup for an important
                    teaching.{' '}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>
                      Taking on someone’s fear is not so easy to spot.
                    </strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Fear is cunning. I still was thinking rationally and trying
                    options, but I was definitely moving from fear, not from
                    faith. I can tell you that for sure. So I was assessing and
                    thinking, but it was motivated by an underlying fear that
                    had gotten really amplified.{' '}

                      <p>
                        How often is the underlying motivation from fear, yet on
                        the surface we are still thinking rationally, using the
                        strategic mind and seemingly calm. This is why fear is
                        so cunning. We must be aware that we often take on
                        others’ fears and society’s fears, without even knowing
                        it.

                    So, my assessment of the situation was that Jeff is
                    panicking, nobody is across, I get pulled under every time I
                    try to float, I don’t know what’s going on, nor how to get
                    out of this… Try to float again. And down under I go again.
                    Then the thought, while under water, “Shit. I can’t believe
                    it. On my birthday, after a motorcycle journey, escaping
                    road-killer traffic, and I die in the river…. My mom will be
                    so disappointed.” I honestly thought that my mom would be
                    disappointed. Not disappointed in my life, but that I’m gone
                    and really didn’t need to die this way. This river swimming
                    was just extra fun, and I didn’t “have to” do it as part of
                    the motorcycle journey. So to me it felt like a silly way to
                    die.

                    I saw rafting boats close enough to us that I thought they’d
                    be able to see us. I can live and that’s my best bet. So I
                    yelled and waved my arms and the boats came.{' '}

                  <p class='mb-0'>
                    <strong>I didn’t feel at peace with death.</strong>

                  <p>
                    I wanted to live for sure. That’s beautiful, the desire to
                    live. But at that moment, I definitely was not at peace with
                    death. There have been other times in my life where I wanted
                    to live but surrendered to death, so I know the difference.
                    In The Highest Pass we had ridden at night, blinded by
                    lights, traffic, cliffs, and I full on just surrendered to
                    death. I remember realizing that I could either ride
                    stressed out, holding on for dear life, or I could let go
                    and know that I could die any moment… it was a big lesson…
                    but as we know, the journey ever evolves and is never over.{' '}

                  <p>
                    And if we look at life, we often take on another’s fear and
                    then amplify it and continue it on to those around us. These
                    are the ripples we spoke of in Chapter Five. When Anand is
                    silent, its like a clear pond and he can see the ripples
                    coming off people instantly. When waves hit each other, they
                    can double up and soon the waters become really really
                    choppy. The fear wave turns into rapids. Society says “be
                    afraid”, and now it’s a storm. And in a storm, we will use
                    the fears and stories to justify anything to stay alive, but
                    we don’t realize that we took on this idea of a storm. Are
                    we really in the storm that we think we are in? Is it really
                    do or die?

                  <p>
                    One might see two sides to my story, but I do not. My desire
                    to live is pure. That’s no question. But did I surrender and
                    live in faith/love or did I move from fear? Fear won.{' '}

                    As we continue in this chapter, let’s keep this idea our
                    minds: Responsibility for our own freedom demands a courage
                    that is nothing short of our totality.{' '}

                        Move the way love makes you move. Fear only leads to
                        violence and escape. It does not lead to Life. Fear
                        seeks escape from life.

                    I didn’t really speak to anyone the rest of that day. I was
                    silent. I was looking around, just watching. I was upset at
                    myself too, but I knew not to stay upset for too long. Did I
                    learn the lesson? Yes, but I needed to also eventually find
                    gratitude for the life I still was blessed with and am
                    blessed to have. I can’t beat myself up when the fact is

                    About eight hours later we were at the school with the kids,
                    as you see in the episode. After some time there, I finally
                    mustered the energy to play soccer with them in the
                    courtyard. Sports always have had a way of bringing me back
                    in my body, present and joyful. Ironically though, I twisted
                    my ankle badly while playing. I needed some ice but they
                    didn’t have any. Since we were right along the Ganga River,
                    I simply walked over to her and soaked my ankle in her
                    frigid waters. Sometimes a witch. Sometimes a mother.{' '}

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That story feels like it could be a whole chapter in itself,
                    but there is much more to come. As I mentioned, I eventually
                    had to come to some gratitude for life. I had to remember
                    that life is sacred. And this, I think, is one tertiary
                    level of sacred:{' '}
                    <strong>
                      The understanding that we can be truly grateful for life
                      and thus life is sacred to us.
                    </strong>{' '}
                    But I want to offer up a potentially deeper understanding of
                    sacred. I submit that sacred is beyond this “gratitude” that
                    comes from knowing something is precious and can be gone at
                    any moment. I believe that sacred cannot be had or lost.
                    We’ll need to investigate this more deeply to fully
                    understand.

                  <p class='mb-0'>
                    <strong>Something sacred cannot be had or lost.</strong>

                  <p>
                    Sacred does not need to imply a sense of gratitude while it
                    is here. I know that the word sacred usually has this air of
                    “appreciation” to it. And I meant this when I talked about
                    it in the series, that we should really value our moments
                    and the great opportunity we have to influence each other
                    with a smile or find joy by simply appreciating another
                    person. Right? One day your parents will be gone, so take
                    time to really look at them and enjoy them. One day we might
                    not be able to walk, so appreciate the feel of the sand in
                    our toes as we slither on the beach. But I also do think
                    that the true sacred nature of things, is knowing that they
                    cannot be lost or had… and yet while knowing that,
                    nevertheless continue to still give it our full appreciation
                    and focus.

                  <p>
                    It sounds like I have written myself into a Pandora’s Box.
                    How am I going to explain or get out of this? We’ll see as I
                    write. I hope I can because it does make sense in my head
                    and in my heart.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You see, I believe the very nature of the word Sacred is
                    given value by the way we feel about it. Perhaps that’s
                    truth of a lot of grand words... If we feel something is
                    sacred just because it is really appreciated while it is
                    still here, then sacred is a more temporal thing. I
                    personally would like Sacred to signify much more and to
                    mean much more to me than that. I want to hold “Sacred” to a
                    higher standard than that. I want sacred to have a real high
                    place in that it is not something that can go away. So when
                    I ask myself to see the sacred or have space for sacred in
                    my life, I am asking myself to see the thing that is
                    eternal. If something is sacred, much like principles, it
                    will liberate you. In the very act of seeing the sacred, you
                    take it on. The word implies you have to participate in the
                    perception. When you look for and acknowledge the sacred,
                    you yourself must be in that space.{' '}

                    The Ganga isn’t sacred, per se. But the fact that it holds
                    this “essence of mother” meaning to it, gives it the sacred
                    nature. It is this essence, the always loving and caring
                    mother, which will never falter, never change. The always
                    loving mother is the sacred. And the Ganga has that sacred
                    nature to it too, if you choose to see it.{' '}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So what is it that is sacred in another person, when you see
                    them? Very similar to the Ganga.

                    fear of losing yourself is an obstacle to freedom and truth…
                    because that fear might prevent us from surrendering to the
                    mystery, to the greatness we can become.{' '}

                    If I give my heart fully to someone, be it a person, a
                    project or to nature, then it’s sacred not because I can
                    lose my heart or have my heart broken. No. It is a sacred
                    love because it can never be fully held, taken or lost. Only
                    that is true love. That is the love to hold sacred, not the
                    other temporary love. Likewise, the aspect of life that
                    doesn’t die is the one to hold sacred – call it the soul or
                    the super conscious – that is sacred.

                    I am also saying that things become more sacred, that this
                    idea of sacred takes on its true value, when something is
                    realized to be untouchable by loss. Then we start to realize
                    its real value, its true nature. As you see that you cannot
                    lose your heart (which takes some life experience and many
                    relationships to remember), then you see that your
                    heart/your love is sacred.

                    I’d say we become more sacred, more full of that “Stuff”
                    which will never be taken from us when we choose to see life
                    this way. That might feel a bit far-fetched, but it can be
                    practiced in all those small moments that I speak of at the
                    end of the episode. You practice and stay present and allow

                      The Big Wisdom From Episode 10 – Greater Than We Know{' '}

                  <p>
                    This is the title of the chapter, so it’s about time we get
                    to it right!? Sacred is a nice lead in though as the way I
                    am speaking about sacred will naturally give us access to
                    and allow us to be greater than we know (or have known). If
                    we simply make space and practice seeing the undying nature
                    of some things… maybe for a year… then we will expand. When
                    we allow ourselves to see something as mysterious and beyond
                    the confines of our mind. Then, we are actually developing a
                    muscle. What muscle? The muscle of allowing for something
                    beyond what we know… and this will naturally extend and
                    include our perception of ourselves.
                  </p>
                  <p class='mb-0'>
                    <strong>
                      This is good news. As our perception of the world becomes
                      greater, then we become greater.{' '}
                    </strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And I guarantee you that you will also see a clearer path to
                    freedom. You will naturally forgive more often. You will
                    take more moments to hear the principles you have committed
                    to. You will witness your conditioned mind. You will live in
                    freedom.

                    <strong>
                      Sometimes it’s important to think of your life as one
                      lifetime of a hundred of your lifetimes.
                    </strong>{' '}
                    That way you can approach this lifetime to perhaps learn
                    something rather than achieve something. If this is one of
                    many lives, then I’m not going to get so bent out of shape
                    about the material things and might let the whole life be a
                    lesson, a training session. When we think this way about our
                    life, we become greater than we think we are. We actually
                    become more capable of compassion, of self-love, or
                    detachment… We become more courageous, and as I keep
                    reminding you, the commitment to freedom takes great
                    courage.{' '}

                    This is a call back to the first two episodes. Remember that
                    Anand is urging everyone to get ready to embrace the
                    challenges and break free of the bubbles of perception that
                    they keep around their identities.{' '}

                  <p>
                    In this Episode 10, each character experiences and is
                    reflecting on how they have popped that bubble, embraced the
                    challenge, and defied their identity. Ken has experienced a
                    world that defies his rational mind, something very new to
                    him. Mark has found some peace in “not knowing” what his
                    next step in the mid-life crisis is; he has become ok with
                    the mystery. Ryan has accepted his true power and now knows
                    how harmful it is to not step into that power. He can no
                    longer hide!

                    I heard someone say once, that forgiveness is a choice. That
                    we don’t need to wait until we don’t have bad feelings about
                    someone in order to forgive him or her. That we can choose
                    to forgive before we “feel” at ease with a person. I love
                    this because it’s just like courage. You don’t wait to have
                    no fear before having courage… you choose to be courageous
                    even amidst fear.{' '}

                    If we think back to Episode 2, Anand is insisting that Fred
                    and Elle call upon a state of calmness before the
                    circumstances and “feelings” of being ok with riding are
                    there. He asks them to know the state of calmness and call
                    it in before its happened. It’s that quantum leap of jumping
                    to the next state. And so it makes a lot of sense that, here
                    at the end of the series, Anand is really sounding the horns
                    of freedom being a choice.

                      Forgiveness is a choice. Courage is a choice. Calmness is

                    We do not need to wait until we are free on the “outside”
                    before we choose freedom. This choice in fact takes courage.
                    This choice in fact means you take absolute responsibility
                    too… Responsibility for what? For exactly the quote I used
                    above. That the world around you is happening inside of you…
                    you are the experiencer and you decide. So freedom takes you
                    owning the fact that you are responsible for your perception
                    of the world. It also demands that you accept your true
                    power. We spoke in great detail on this in Chapter Seven and
                    Eight. We need to step into our power and know that this
                    power is not over anyone, it is not based on money, sex,
                    fame… on anything outside of us. If it is, its not true
                    power. Your true power is an unbounded sacred force. But
                    accepting it takes a lot of courage, because life changes…
                    you change… you become greater than you think you are.{' '}

                        realized that we all have the choice of how we see life.

                    It is no doubt that story is powerful. It is also no doubt
                    that we are inundated with more media and stories than ever
                    before. But the real question is, what are these stories
                    telling us about ourselves and how to behave? How are these
                    stories informing us and our next generations about what it
                    means to be human? One of the main purposes of story is to
                    help us grow and to teach us how to live. Throughout the
                    ages there has been a reverence for story in this way. But
                    currently, it feels like we are fed archetypes that are very
                    mundane – celebrities, reality stars, Instagram stars, gang
                    leaders, and violent heroes in video games…{' '}

                      We are fed very superficial and artificial archetypes and

                    There is also the issue that even when we are given positive
                    qualities through media role models (much like I outlined in
                    each chapter), that they are then attached to traditional
                    archetypes of the “savior” or the “redeemed hero” that tend
                    to revolve around the main character achieving some success
                    or being rewarded/attaining some prince or princess to live
                    happily ever after. In essence, we sometimes get the
                    positive qualities right, but are then often still told to
                    seek self on the outside. So it is important that we come to
                    understand a new level of expectation of story and media.

                        In the world there have been so many stories… There are
                        two stories. Stories that destroy you and stories that
                        help evolve you. Those that help evolve you are from the
                        wisdom traditions. Those that destroy you are from the
                        mental traditions. The stories from the mental
                        traditions put shackles on you. Stories from the wisdom
                        traditions cut off the shackles.

                    I often use the above to help define what “Conscious” media
                    is. Conscious media will ultimately unshackle you and evolve
                    you. Unconscious media will continue the bondage.

                    Now, I want to be really clear that I am not saying that all
                    media must be conscious. I want to be clear that I am not
                    saying to avoid entertainment. But it is important to be
                    aware of where we are ingesting and getting our nourishment
                    from in the form of media. What stories, shows, movies, are
                    we really taking in to help us evolve?

                      Not every show needs to be spiritual, set in India, or
                      tell you how to live. Maybe that’s why I love comedy so
                      much.

                    Because in someway it brings about awareness of who we
                    really are without putting it in a spiritual box. Comedy
                    often makes fun of our ability or disability to know how to
                    live. We laugh at our failings. We also laugh at the brutal
                    honesty of our ego finally being shown. Eight years ago when
                    Anand stayed with me for a summer in Los Angeles, we would
                    often watch Larry David’s Curb Your Enthusiasm. This show is
                    pure entertaining laughs and Larry David is the most front
                    forward and outward caricature of ego. That’s what’s great.
                    Its totally unmasking the ego, letting it run wild and say
                    whatever it wants to. Larry had this anger that goes
                    unchecked and we get to see what his world turns into when
                    the ego is totally running the show. And it ain’t pretty.{' '}

                      Laughter is spirituality, lets be honest. It opens you up.
                    </strong>{' '}
                    It cracks you open for a moment. In that crack, that gap,
                    that space… then finally light can come in. I used to say
                    that all I am trying to do when teaching yoga is to create a
                    small crack in your normal life, a little gap that will open
                    up for a moment… and then the light will naturally come
                    shining back in. I don’t have to put light in. Just get the
                    crack open and life naturally fills with light.

                    When we watch stories on television, we empathize with
                    characters. We feel scared with them, we hope for redemption
                    for them, we cheer for them, and something about them
                    resonates with us. Hopefully what resonates are their
                    virtues and strengths. Here is a reminder of the six major
                    virtues and their sub virtues.

                    It is important to remember that Fred came into this seeking
                    to figure out what it really means to be human. He wondered
                    if he could be more than this identity he had built up of a
                    lawyer at age 75. We love his <b>Honesty</b> here, that of
                    the self-aware lawyer that realizes life has passed him by.
                    Plus this desire to know the truth (this{' '}
                    <b>Love of Learning</b>) epitomizes <b>Courage</b> and{' '}
                    <b>Transcendence.</b> We need this desire in order to bust
                    our bubble. By the end of the series Fred is feeling loved,
                    accepted and genuinely wants to take this greater awareness
                    back home with him to approach his life and loved ones in a
                    new manner. It is never too late to change.

                    I mentioned this moment from Episode Two where Anand told
                    Elle that she had to bring in the calm now or she cannot
                    ride. He was asking her to make a quantum leap and feel the
                    feelings before the outward world was telling her it was ok.
                    I referenced this here in Chapter Ten to remind us that
                    Freedom is a choice. So as we make small daily choices to
                    bring in the calm or to go beyond what our world and mind
                    tells us, we are creating the neural network in our brains
                    for freedom. We must make these quantum leaps. We must
                    continue to leap, because what was once a stretch becomes
                    normal and life will again serve up the opportunity to go
                    beyond.{' '}

                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Remember that Jen had been sober for a few years before the
                    trip. In doing so, she stopped numbing the pain and what
                    surfaced was an eye opener. I bring this up because as we
                    make changes and invite more awareness, we are apt to see
                    that we are not happy in certain areas of our lives. So
                    although we have more awareness, there could be pain and
                    sadness as a result. The beauty is that Jen, when realizing
                    she was not happy, Persevered in her steps to evolve. So
                    much so that she brought her husband Jeff on this moto
                    journey through the Himalayas. And she, throughout the trip,
                    continued to listen, practice and really rise up. So much so
                    that by Episode 6 she was willing to let Jeff go if he
                    couldn’t be himself with her or the family. Happiness is
                    more important that keeping Jeff around or keeping her life
                    safe… I feel that was a key moment for her and for him. The
                    other really big moment was in Episode 9 where they chose to
                    release the past and start fresh. Forgiveness! Forgiveness
                    is choice and they chose to do so. They chose to release the
                    fragmented resentment that only is keeping them from being
                    happy.{' '}

                  <p>
                    In this bonus footage we are with Anand on a bridge, under
                    the full moon in Badrinath. Badrinath is the sustenance
                    principle, the continued practice. I saved this bonus
                    footage for now because it is a reminder of how we need to
                    continually listen and get empty in order to tune in. Plus,
                    he reminds us how important it is where we go and who we
                    surround ourselves with. Having a strong group of people
                    around you is key, Sangha.{' '}

                    And lastly, in case any of this course has come across as
                    Hindu or anything religious, it’s really not. Anand reminds
                    us that what we are doing is evolving and exploring our
                    spirituality. This is not a religion. This is inclusive.
                    Inclusivity is expansive.{' '}

                    MEDITATION/MANTRA: GREATER THAN YOU KNOW

                    <strong>
                      Ignite the greater self. Own the Responsibility for how we

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In this meditation we begin with Nadi Shodhana, the
                    alternate nostril breathing for energizing and balancing.
                    Then we awaken the inner fire and strength of Self through
                    Agni Sara. Then we bring in a wonderfully powerful Kriya,
                    Alakh Niranjan – awakening our true and timeless self. We
                    follow this kriya with the HU Meditation. Hu is the sound of
                    your longing. In this case, it is our shared longing for
                    that which is our birthright, freedom! This mantra also
                    evokes devotion, connects us to the divine, and releases
                    fear.

                    Life is greater than our expectations, thankfully so. That
                    if life turned out the way human beings thought it would, we
                    would be in big trouble. People would be falling off the
                    edges, because they expected that if you walk far enough you
                    would fall of the edge of the earth.
