                  <p>
                    Building on our skill of “falling into the unknown,” from
                    Chapter Four, we now explore a specific unknown. That
                    unknown is of the space between words, between thoughts, and
                    even between particles. This is the Gap. This is the
                    Silence. And this holds great power. In fact, this is what
                    quantum physics would call the unlimited field of potential.
                    And to access that gap, is an art form that takes great
                    courage and commitment.{' '}

                      With the first sacred peak of Kedarnath traversed, we head
                      to Tungnath, to the find the Freedom in the Gap.

                    This journey in Episode Five takes us up 12,000ft to a Shiva
                    temple, then another 1,000ft to the temple of Chandrashila,
                    which represents Creation (feminine) above Destruction
                    (masculine.) Not all riders make it up, but those who do
                    make it up are feeling intense energy, great emotion, and
                    deep awakening. But that awakening is quickly attacked by an
                    attack of ignorance, which turns into the perfect lesson: A
                    scorpion is a scorpion. Ignorance is ignorance, even in the
                    Himalayas.

                    <strong>
                      True to form, I want to share a couple of experiences that
                      I believe can help you understand this idea of the gap.
                    </strong>{' '}
                    I like to make things a bit more accessible, even if these
                    “accessible” examples happen to occur in India or with an
                    Oracle.{' '}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The first example was in 2007, about 12 years ago now, when
                    I was in India studying with Anand. We went to Vashistha
                    Cave, about 45 min outside Rishikesh. It is a cave where a
                    wise master had long ago meditated for over 30 years
                    straight. Anand himself, when studying under his guru, spent
                    3 months at an adjacent cave in total silence and out of
                    contact with the outside world.{' '}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Currently, there is a monastery there and you can visit the
                    cave and meditate. It’s pitch black inside and as I sunk
                    into meditation I had this strange feeling of looking back
                    at myself from outside my body. Hard to explain, but I can
                    only imagine the sense of timelessness that one feels after
                    days upon days of existing without light, sound, or much
                    contact… Is that the example I wanted to share? Not really,
                    because sitting in a dark cave for days or weeks is not very
                    relatable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The example gets clearer when we left the cave and went to
                    sit on large boulders along the nearby river. I was looking
                    at the forest across the river, in a very calm state, and
                    everything seemed purple and yellow. I can quite easily drop
                    into that state now, even as I write, letting the eyes go
                    wide and sinking into calm… everything takes on a glow. But
                    there I was, on the banks of the river, seeing purple and
                    yellow, and wondering “Now what do I do?”{' '}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After that experience I went to Anand and asked him “What am
                    I supposed to do with that? Where do I go next? What
                    technique and where to look so I can see more…?”{' '}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Anand laughed.</strong>

                    It was a great lesson and continues to be. I was always
                    trying to go deeper or attain some ability to see auras or
                    some “spiritual” skill. In some ways I was constantly
                    processing this thing called spiritual growth, with the very
                    mind that can’t comprehend it (or tends to confine it.) When
                    we do this, we start to put our path into a box. And so, by
                    Anand asking me to simply enjoy it, he is asking me to
                    continue to “be in the Gap.” He knows that whatever I need
                    to know or realize, will come when I need it. He knows the
                    key is to be receptive, present, and enjoy it… I think we
                    can all relate to this. We so often are trying to fit life’s
                    experience into our agenda or use the moment as the next
                    step to the next thing. Why not stay in the bliss or stay in
                    the moments of peace and calm, rather than this continued
                    pursuit of more? It’s like applying a capitalistic ambitious
                    idea of the world to one’s spiritual journey… if you do, you
                    are going to miss a lot, you are going to miss the gap… and
                    you are going to miss all the power it holds. Ready?{' '}

                  <p>
                    Oh wait, what about the other example with the oracle, you
                    ask? Well, remember in The Highest Pass (my first time
                    riding in the Himalayas) we saw an oracle. At the end of
                    that experience Anand says some words that I believe sum up
                    the power, importance, and lesson of being in the Gap. It
                    shows us that the real freedom, the power, and the truth
                    (dharma) come from the mystery, the gap, not from the place
                    or the way we think it should come.{' '}

                    <strong>The Gap.</strong>Existing in the Gap takes courage,
                    detachment, a stepping into one’s power, and leads us to
                    great freedom. Here in chapter five we are building on what
                    we have learned so far, so let’s take a moment to review
                    that. We began with quantum leaps. Then we went on to look
                    at the stories we use to keep us stuck from those leaps.
                    Then we explored the Ego and its traps of craving, aversion,
                    blame, and escape. Then we dove into the embracing of the
                    unknown. Now, we are ready to sit in that unknown, to exist
                    and practice being in the gap, the silence. This is an art
                    form onto itself that requires you to allow your own power
                    to appear/arise/reveal itself to you – the power of your
                    being.{' '}

                  <p>
                    The courage is of course to exist in the unknown. The
                    courage to not jump on the ego’s back to avert or crave or
                    strategize out of the moment’s current feelings and
                    circumstance. This is why our meditation practice of
                    awareness, of being a witness, is so important to building
                    this courage and stabilizing power within us.

                    <strong>The Detachment</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The detachment is to not take the circumstances or feelings
                    as personal, as “yours.” The detachment is to realize the
                    reactions to such circumstances are patterns, are stories,
                    and are inherently not you. Much of it is conditioned. But
                    when those stories are all you know of yourself… Well, again
                    it takes courage to detach from this being your identity.
                    (When we say detachment, it’s not the opposite of
                    attachment. So, we are not asking you to not like anything
                    or enjoy something or have preference. We are asking that we
                    detach our identity from what the ego and our conditioning
                    has created as the “I”. We are asking and offering that our
                    identity is more than the conditioned stories… but we must
                    be willing to detach from what we think we are… we must have
                    some space for a new “you”, and this is unknown (at least to
                    you now), so we detach from what we know ourselves to be,
                    and make space for the bigger potential. This is part of the
                    power in the gap.

                    <strong>The Art of Silence</strong>

                  <p>
                    All too often we fill the moments in between with chatter,
                    with our phones, and thoughts… the list goes on. In fact,
                    before writing this paragraph I texted someone. I kind of
                    needed a break from writing… well then take an actual pause
                    Adam!?! Yeah, we fill our moments in between way too often.
                    What happens when we don’t? You will find out only when you
                    stay in the GAP. The very act of staying in the GAP, is an
                    act of stepping into and accepting your own power. You are
                    acknowledging you are part of the field, the universe. This
                    is an art form, because it takes skill, and it’s always ever
                    changing… much like dancing or playing sports or painting…
                    its always new.

                    silence… Anand asked us to practice existing in the gap, and
                    we did for hours. Tungnath means the lord of the Gap
                    (technically Tung means narrow and Nath means Lord). By the
                    time we were reaching the second temple, Chandrashila at
                    13,000ft, Ken was feeling like the mountains were coming
                    alive and filling him with energy, literally pulling him up
                    toward the top. His mind had no rational explanation for
                    this, but yet he allowed it to keep happening. I love the
                    word allow. He allowed it, didn’t fight it, and didn’t need
                    to explain it. In essence he surrendered to it and stayed in
                    it. Ultimately at the top he had an experience of connecting
                    with his murdered sister, but I’ll leave the details of that
                    for the character virtues section.

                    As I said last chapter, when we jump into the unknown we
                    have this natural byproduct of destruction of or burning of
                    the ego. Then, as we stay in that unknown, in that space, in
                    comes energy and creation! The peak of Tungnath is the
                    perfect metaphor for this. The first temple is for Shiva at
                    12,000ft. representing destruction, the masculine, Shiva.
                    The second temple is for Chandrashila, representing
                    creation, the feminine. This is 1,000ft higher up at
                    13,000ft. If you look at a picture of Shiva you’ll see that
                    the crescent moon is sitting above his head. The creation
                    principle always sits above the destruction principle.{' '}

                    I think it is super important to know that the creation sits
                    above destruction. Why? It may help us leap into the unknown
                    more often. It may help us exist in the gap more often when
                    we know that creation will usually give birth to
                    the/something new in this space. But it all takes practice,
                    it takes skill, and therefore it is an art form, so we must
                    practice to succeed.

                    <strong>Anand’s ability to be in the Gap.</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Spending years knowing Anand I’ve witnessed this at a high
                    level. I’ve also spoken to him about this ability. What he
                    related to me is that being in the gap is like existing on a
                    clear lake, a clear pond. When you are there, you then see
                    any ripples that come. It’s easy to see ripples on a clear
                    pond. So it’s easy for him to know and see what’s going on
                    inside people. There are ripples coming off of them and
                    since he is in silence he can see/feel them. If the lake
                    isn’t clear, if its rough, it is not as easy to pick up on
                    things. So the clear pond, the person existing in the gap,
                    has access to a lot of information coming at them. Do you
                    need to be totally still and quite to be clear and in the
                    gap? No. Again, it’s an art. It will help to be quiet and
                    still when developing, but ultimately, we can be in the
                    world and in life and hiking and still be clear… of course
                    that’s possible, otherwise what would be the use of it?

                  <p>
                    I really love this episode because we lay out the idea of
                    the gap, then Ken and the others experience it, and then
                    that experience and bliss gets totally ripped away from Ken
                    by a man down at the Shiva temple. The episode is like all
                    of life wrapped up in one hike. Ken comes to the Shiva
                    temple and a guy says to him “Now give me money!” And he is
                    ripped out of his blissful state. How could such a thing
                    happen at such a sacred place? How could scorpions exist
                    here in the sacred Himalayas and at a sacred temple?

                    I love this explanation from Anand. Ignorance is ignorance.
                    Ignorance exists everywhere. The key is to not let it steal
                    power from us. This is so important.
                    <strong>
                      This is what we mean when we say that it takes detachment
                      to exist in the gap.
                    </strong>{' '}
                    You cannot take it personally that ignorance exists or is in
                    front of you. Detach from taking it personally. And in case
                    we all think we should be little Buddhas, let me assure you
                    that often it really too is too much to ask to be
                    compassionate with that ignorance. So the key is to just
                    practice indifference at first. Don’t take it personally, be
                    indifferent to it. That way, we don’t let it take away our
                    love or our power. And if we can’t be indifferent to it,
                    guess what? We are triggered and, in some way, we want that
                    other person’s reaction or opinion or behavior to support
                    our identity. When it doesn’t, we freak out.{' '}

                    In our episode, Ken has an amazing experience, then at the
                    lower temple has this battle with an ignorant particle
                    (person) and he immediately gets angered and pulled out of
                    his bliss… This really is a great reminder of what we were
                    learning in Chapter Three about the cunning ego and its
                    ability to blame. Now we see how the Ego’s attachment
                    patterns try to rip life away from us. What Ken wanted was
                    the perfect picture of an experience, the bliss atop, the
                    temple below… when it wasn’t, he lost control of his ideal.

                    often we mask it in the ego, the conditioning, and need to
                    take steps to reveal it again. But lets be clear, you are
                    not going out there to achieve the truth, to find the path.
                    It is in you already and we are simply revealing it. And
                    it’s much easier to reveal when in the gap, when silent.

                    have come together in a symphony of expression to create

                    in the gap between all the particles, between the atoms. You
                    are in the quantum field. You are the gap. You are actually

                    take responsibility that we are this very powerful being.

                        This is helpful to know and can spur you to leap, to be
                        ok with the unknown, to exist in the gap.

                        When we are silent we easily see what’s occurring around
                        us, we see the ego clearly.

                      <p>
                        As with my story of looking at the forest, sometimes
                        just be in it. Lets drop this need for the next step.
                        Sometimes there is nothing to do. The understanding
                        comes from the love, the gap, not the other way around.

                    CHARACTER VIRTUES & SPECIFIC MOMENTS WE SEE THE TEACHINGS
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                    When we watch stories on television, we empathize with
                    characters. We feel scared with them, we hope for redemption
                    for them, we cheer for them, and something about them
                    resonates with us. Hopefully what resonates are their
                    virtues and strengths. Here is a reminder of the six major
                    virtues and their sub virtues.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>COURAGE:</strong> Bravery, Honesty, Perseverance,
                    Zest.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>HUMANITY:</strong> Love, Kindness, Social
                    Intelligence
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>WISDOM & KNOWLEDGE:</strong> Creativity, Curiosity,
                    Judgment, Love of Learning, Perspective
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>TRANSCENDENCE:</strong> Gratitude, Hope, Humor,
                    Spirituality, Appreciation
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>JUSTICE:</strong> Teamwork, Fairness, Leadership *I
                    personally like the word Inclusivity, which I feel falls in
                    Teamwork and Fairness.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>TEMPERANCE: </strong>Forgiveness, Humility,
                    Prudence, Self-Regulation.{' '}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These are also qualities to reinforce and that give us
                    greater access to freedom. Let’s see how the characters
                    embodied this (or didn’t.) and how it brings to light the
                    wisdoms and realizations of the episode. Also note that for
                    your ease, we have included the specific clips from the
                    episode, so you can easily watch the section again without
                    scrolling through the full episode.{' '}

                    <strong>Wisdom and Knowledge</strong> is shown by Ken’s{' '}
                    <strong>Curiosity.</strong> Ken continually asks questions
                    of the other riders, of Anand, and is sincerely seeking,
                    sincerely <strong>Curious</strong> to see what spirituality
                    can be for him in his life. This process then takes off for
                    him in this episode when he has to accept something beyond
                    his rational mind (the energy of the mountain). So at this
                    moment, the concepts and beliefs turn into real experience
                    and real knowledge. This is going beyond what you can
                    rationalize, beyond belief, and into a deep knowing, this is{' '}
                    <strong>Spirituality,</strong>{' '}
                    <strong>Transcendence.</strong> That experience deepens when
                    the man at the Shiva temple, the ignorant particle, steals
                    him of his bliss. But Ken shows <strong>Humility</strong>{' '}
                    when he asks Anand’s advice and listens. Anand tells Ken
                    that has the power to let the man rob him of his bliss or
                    not. It has nothing to do with the man, the scorpion, the
                    ignorance. It’s all about Ken. And Ken,{' '}
                    <strong>Humbly</strong> agrees and realizes what he has the
                    responsibility and can’t blame the man. This is beautiful
                    and to me represents a complete cycle all in one experience.

                    So Anand is responsible for fifteen people on this journey.
                    Is he constantly thinking and planning and making sure all
                    are ok? No. Is he super multi-tasking? No. He is simply
                    being in the gap and trusting. This takes a lot of{' '}
                    <strong>Courage,</strong> more than you might imagine. He
                    not only trusts it for himself, but trusts that being in the
                    gap will allow him to see whatever is needed for all of us
                    riders/passengers as well.{' '}
                    <strong>This is Leadership</strong> at a very high level. He

                    to more effectively lead. In the end, being in the gap helps
                    him understand each person and what’s going on inside them.

                    DHARMA WISDOM TALK by HIMALAYAN MASTER ANAND MEHROTRA

                  <p>
                    The bonus talk you get to see here was never used in the
                    Road To Dharma series at all! This takes place at a campfire
                    the night before our hike up Tungnath. It really reinforces
                    the ideas from chapter three and four in depth, then goes on
                    to set us up for the journey into the Gap. Sometimes during
                    this talk you won’t see Anand, because it’s dark! So enjoy
                    those moments where it’s just his voice. But mostly, we have
                    the glow of the fire lighting up his face. You feel like you
                    are right there in the Himalayas, the night before a sacred
                    hike.{' '}

                  <p>
                    In addition to strengthening the concepts from previous
                    chapters, in this talk you’ll find:

                    MEDITATION/MANTRAS: FREEDOM IN THE GAP{' '}
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                    In this meditation I will take you into the quantum field.
                    Entering it is not as difficult as you’d think and with this
                    simple visualization you’ll be able to practice this on your
                    own often and even plant seeds into the field that manifest
                    into the material world.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the lead up to that, we’ll do the Nadi Shodhana alternate
                    nostril breathing to balance and energize. Then breath of
                    fire to empty and expand. Then Cosmic Breath 3 to really
                    enliven and expand. Then we bring in a very special mantra
                    that is very appropriate for Tungnath.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is a two-part mantra that involves first wiping away old
                    patterns in the mind, then next inviting in the power of
                    creation in the heart.{' '}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The first part is Om Namah Shivayah, which you may remember
                    from Chapter Three. Here we are calling on our nature that
                    is beyond time and beyond space. We are in essence going
                    beyond the ego, and thus destroying the petty attachments.
                    This will wipe way old mind patterns. Then after that
                    destruction we now have space to call on the creation
                    aspect, just like the ChandraSheila temple sits above the
                    Shiva temple. So part two of the mantra calls on creation.
                    The mantra is Shri Shakti Namaha. This is invoking Shakti,
                    the creative power of the universe.{' '}
                  </p>
                  <p>So, we create the space and allow creation to fill it. </p>

                    You must fall in love first. Then understanding comes from
                    that. Not the reverse. So many seek to understand before
                    they fall in love, but that’s not how it works.
