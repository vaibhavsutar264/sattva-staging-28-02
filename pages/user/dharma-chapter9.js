                  <p>
                    The Wisdom of the four peaks is coming together as we finish
                    the fourth peak, Hemkund Sahib. At this 15,000 ft lake and
                    temple, Anand reminds us that much of the integration of
                    wisdom is still occurring and will more deeply occur when we
                    get back to Rishikesh. So as we embark on these final two
                    chapters, we integrate the wisdoms we’ve learned, forming it
                    into principles that we can refer to in life, especially
                    when we need direction. The principles are beacons of light
                    that lead us to freedom.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>
                      We’ll discover the characteristics of a principle of
                      freedom, talk about a few specific principles, and look at
                      finding our own principles that ring true to us.
                    </strong>

                  <p>
                    In Episode 9, Fred’s dip in the waters shows us how
                    important community and serving each other is.  We support
                    each other’s growth and freedom by stepping into our freedom
                    and by thinking beyond ourselves. This is one principle we
                    will explore, that of thinking beyond the little “I.” As the
                    group leaves Hemkund and makes the long ride back to
                    Rishikesh, they encounter some treacherous night riding and
                    big decisions.  Adam gets a lesson in leadership and the
                    relationship wisdoms are bearing fruit as Jeff begins to
                    understand that he must stand for something bigger than his
                    happiness or the relationship and family will fail. In the
                    end, we come back to making that quantum leap beyond what we
                    know and understand… to serve something greater… and then
                    freedom finds us

                        When we talk about masculine power it is to stand up for
                        principles. Not Dogma or fanaticism. To stand for
                        principles of evolution, principles beyond the ‘what
                        about me’ syndrome.

                    CHAPTER NINE: FREEDOM THROUGH PRINCIPLES
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                    I thought I’d bring us in with a story of money, business,
                    and relationship. When I look back at this experience, I can
                    easily identify what principles were at play.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>There was a man who said I owed him money.</strong>{' '}
                    I know, so many Hollywood films are based on owing someone
                    money and the trouble that ensues, but I promise this is not
                    two hours long, doesn’t involve the mafia or my cousin
                    Vinnie, and nobody dies in the Ozarks. If you don’t
                    understand my references, congratulations, western media
                    hasn’t overtaken your mind space.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    {' '}
                    So, six months after we had settled up on a project he was
                    contracted to do, this man said there was $3,000 more in
                    expenses that he had been charged by a supplier and that I
                    now would owe. It was a shock as you can imagine, six months
                    after something is done and getting hit with $3,000 bill.
                    Had I known of the extra charge (it was not in the quote) I
                    probably would have made different decisions on the project
                    back when I said yes to its completion. Yet, the contractor
                    did not feel it would be correct for him to eat the charges
                    just because they too had forgotten about this extra charge
                    from the supplier. The supplier billed them six months after
                    as well… hmmm, what to do?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    {' '}
                    <strong>
                      I did research and I could not find any proof from the
                      suppliers that there was in fact this extra charge.
                    </strong>{' '}
                    So, I wrote to the contractor to tell him that (a) I
                    couldn’t find any proof that there is this added cost and
                    (b) that had we known about the cost we would have
                    approached the project differently. His email response was
                    immediate and irate.{' '}

                    <strong>
                      He attacked my integrity and went so far as to attack my
                      spirituality… something like, “You call yourself
                      spiritual!? Shame on you!”
                    </strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At this moment I now had the perfect “out.” He has acted
                    like a jerk, attacked me, and this makes it very easy for me
                    to simply not pay. In essence, I can easily now find a
                    reason to not pay… I mean, this guy is being a jerk. So my
                    ego was super happy that it didn’t have to lose $3,000. Make
                    sense? Part of me wanted to be pissed and to just shut the
                    door and walk away with money still in my pocket… but as we
                    learned in Chapter Eight, the moment we think on the level
                    of money, we are in trouble. We must think of energy and the
                    way we can impact the world.{' '}

                        too. To be ready to surrender when needed. A strong
                        spine and a soft heart.

                    So my ego wants to avoid paying $3,000. This is aversion. In
                    order to do that it will blame him for being a jerk. This
                    means I get to escape having to actually deal with the
                    circumstances. Aversion, blame, escape … good old Chapter
                    Three ego creeping in. Instead, I wrote him back expressing
                    that I had known him a long time and that this kind of
                    response seemed well out of character and that should he
                    want to apologize, I would accept his apology. I expressed
                    that 95% of the time I had known him to be helpful and
                    generous and that this really seemed like an outlier of a
                    response.

                    <strong>
                      I told a friend about this as I was doing it and he was
                      quite jaw-dropped that I would respond to an all out
                      attack with such forgiveness, but as I will explore in a
                      moment, I was simply applying some simple principles.

                    {' '}
                    Ten minutes later, the contractor emailed back telling me
                    that a family member had died a day earlier and that this
                    minutia of life seemed so trite that he had lashed out at
                    me. He apologized and the door was open to talk again. We
                    eventually agreed to split the cost, to close the door on
                    that event and keep the door of our relationship open and
                    intact.

                      What principle was at play? What was the key moment?
                    </strong>{' '}
                    The key moment was when the ego wanted to blame and escape,
                    but instead I chose to look to principles. I looked to the
                    principle of evolution – what would grow both me and the
                    other – and in that moment I knew I would grow by stepping
                    beyond my ego and fear around money. Plus, I give him the
                    opportunity to grow by creating space in my email rather
                    than fighting back. In the end, two very well versed
                    spiritual guys were able to step into evolution. That’s the
                    principle of evolution. When we look to this principle AND
                    apply it, it will heal me and those around me. And it did.{' '}

                      Understanding Principles that lead us to Freedom.{' '}
                    </strong>
                    This chapter is about principles, specifically the
                    principles that lead us to freedom. Some are universal and
                    we will lay those out. Others, are unique and found by each
                    person in accord with where they are at in life. I think it
                    makes sense then, to talk about the aspects of these
                    principles that help us know they will lead us to freedom.
                    That way, you know if a principle not only (a) resonates
                    with you, but also (b) contains the aspects that lead to
                    freedom.

                      In Road To Dharma, at the end of Episode Nine:
                    </strong>
                    We see the wisdom that has been building throughout this
                    series finally bringing us back to the Ganga River where the
                    journey began. In fact, as we arrive to Rishikesh we do a
                    little flashback to Anand and I walking along the Ganga from
                    Episode 1. Here we were discussing peoples’ various views of
                    the Ganga. And it is a great lesson in principles.

                        People come here, they see the Ganga and they forget
                        that she is also a fierce mother… It becomes part of a
                        religious thing. They dip, get excited… Then the mother
                        takes them (under and down)… Then she is not a mother
                        anymore, she’s a witch. So it doesn’t take long to go
                        from mother to witch…That’s human life. As long as she
                        is an idea, she can turn into a witch… But for me she is
                        always a mother.

                    So for some, the Mother Ganga falls into dogma. And for
                    others, it is a belief or idea. But all that changes when
                    her rapids pull them under and life is flashing before their
                    eyes. For it to be a principle, it cannot be so finicky, so
                    apt to or depending on circumstance or the lens through
                    which we see… how could that guide us wisely? It couldn’t.
                    Nor does it lead to freedom truly. Is it cool that Episode 1
                    began with this discussion and Episode 9 ends with me in the
                    Ganga about to drown… yeah, its cool for the story coming
                    full circle, but it wasn’t cool to us, who were about to
                    drown. I’ll go into much more detail about that experience
                    in Chapter Ten, revealing things way beyond what we see in
                    the series.

                      The principle is that the Ganga is always a mother.{' '}
                    </strong>
                    You might say, “Well, I don’t know the Ganga or have that
                    belief or have any experience with her at all… how does that
                    help me?” Let’s boil it down to something simpler and at the
                    same time far bigger: the universe is always a mother. Boil
                    it down and scale it up some more? Okay, here it is: The
                    universe is always working for me. Always
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>The universe is always working for me.</strong>It’s
                    great to say this as a concept, but remember in Chapter
                    Eight we discussed how important it is to really know
                    something. When we really know something, then the way we
                    experience life will alter. If we really embrace that the
                    universe is working for us on all levels, we would not fall
                    into “victim,” we would not fall into “lack,” into “worry,”
                    or into “why me?” and so on… or if we do fall into it for a
                    moment, we easily can laugh at ourselves and let the
                    cunning, whining ego go bye-bye.

                    <strong>This principle heals the body too!</strong>
                    When we apply “the universe is always working for me” then
                    we get a physical benefit as well. I had the honor of
                    producing the feature documentary HEAL with director Kelly
                    Noonan Gores. One of the underlying through lines of the
                    film was that we are either in fight or flight or in rest
                    and repair. We are either in a state of stress (sympathetic
                    nervous system) or a state of ease (Parasympathetic nervous
                    system.) It can be more complex than this actually, but as a
                    general rule this is a great model for assessing one’s state
                    of being. What the film goes into and proves through science
                    and experience is that when we are mentally worried, afraid,
                    in lack, or in fear, then our body goes into a fight or
                    flight response. The hormones of stress are then released
                    and this eventually leads to inflammation, chronic disease
                    and illness. The root cause can be that we hold the
                    worldview that ‘the universe is against us’. This attitude
                    causes resistance and stress. In contrast, when one holds
                    the principled view of the universe, that it is working for
                    us, then we tend to be in a state of ease, gratitude,
                    courage, faith and in general the body is then able to go
                    into rest and repair mode… And the body does this healing
                    naturally. Health is natural. I mean, the fact that the body
                    naturally heals itself should remind us that the universe is
                    working for us… but yeah, we often forget.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To review this first aspect of a freedom principle: a
                    Principle is not dogma, belief, or opinion. A Principle
                    holds true regardless of conditions, where as dogma, belief,
                    and opinion are very circumstantially dependent. Thus dogma,
                    belief and opinion are not things we can reliably look to
                    for direction. One day the Ganga is mother, one day she is
                    evil. One day someone is our friend, the next day they are
                    against us. What and who to trust then...? We must know The
                    Principle that the universe is working for us, regardless of
                    circumstances. This principle will not only spiritually set
                    us free; it also helps heal the body. Yeah, a bit of a two
                    for one. Feel free to go watch Heal the documentary film as
                    well; it will inspire and expand your perception of this
                    principle of both freedom and healing.

                      Principles will heal you and those around you.
                    </strong>
                    This is so important. A principle will not just benefit you.
                    It will bring freedom and healing to those around you as
                    well. This goes hand in hand with the next aspect of
                    principles of freedom.

                      Principles are bigger than the little “What about me?”{' '}
                    </strong>
                    We are not looking for things that keep that little idea of
                    our identified self intact. We are looking for principles
                    that lead us beyond the ego. A principle of freedom will
                    lead us toward a worldview that is for the community, of
                    service to all. And this leads us to the next aspect.

                    <strong>Principles are inclusive, not exclusive.</strong>
                    They don’t just work for me, for my religion, for my race,
                    etc… When we apply the principle, we will feel expansive and
                    can consider others in our worldview.

                        Selflessness. Inclusion. Not Exclusion. That’s a strong
                        Principle. A woman will test a man on that. And if he is
                        weak, she’ll lose all respect for him. So a strong
                        principle is an expanded view, a grander sense of life,
                        and a grander sense of self… Selflessness. Not a self
                        centered living… all this ‘What about me?’ and ‘I want
                        this or that.’ A true woman will test a man and won’t
                        respect him, even if she might feel happy in the moment.

                    <strong>Principles don’t create false power.</strong>
                    We are not looking for principles that give us power over
                    anyone or anything. So, the principle of supply and demand
                    is not a principle of freedom. It’s just an idea, and really
                    it’s an idea that creates scarcity and ultimately gives one
                    person power over a resource and power over others. It is
                    not a principle of freedom, not even close. I have no doubt
                    that supply and demand exists, its just not going to be
                    something to look to if you are interested in freedom. Make
                    sense? I could have harnessed supply and demand with the
                    contractor and told him I’ll tell everyone in the community
                    that he is a liar and thus there will be no demand for him
                    and his work anymore. Use the principle of supply and demand
                    to have false power and keep the ego intact. Or, instead, I
                    can look to include, go bigger than me, heal self and heal
                    others…{' '}

                    <strong>Freedom cannot be contained. </strong>
                    This is a reminder that freedom is never truly stagnant.
                    It’s not an arrival somewhere to an end game. So we must
                    always continue to grow. We can’t put freedom in a box. This
                    is exactly why we are talking about the principles that lead
                    to freedom. You can look to these principles to help you
                    live, explore, experience, and understand freedom. We are
                    not telling you that “free people” craft emails like X, Y,
                    or Z. Instead, we are laying out how these principles guide
                    us toward a more free experience of life.

                  <p>
                    <strong>The Principles of Evolution.</strong>I spoke about
                    this in my example at the beginning of the chapter. So when
                    push came to shove I had to lean into the principle of
                    evolution. I needed to ask myself what would evolve me in
                    that of a money dispute. I needed to see what would grow me
                    and then to double down and apply the principle of “heal me
                    and those around me.” And I sincerely did want to create an
                    opportunity for me and for the contractor to both grow. He
                    didn’t have to, but I surely had the ability to create the
                    opportunity (the cracked open door) for him to do so. It’s
                    in my power to do that, so I did. It is not the easy way
                    out, but it is a simple way forward… to freedom.

                  <p>
                    <strong>The Principle of Abundance</strong>
                    It is not law of attraction. It is not getting all the
                    things you want or desire by envisioning them. The principle
                    of abundance is knowing you are truly abundant. One way to
                    encapsulate it is to remember the story of Anand’s father in
                    Chapter Eight. He was happy when he got the money/gems so
                    why shouldn’t he be happy when he lost them. Abundance is a
                    state of being and relies on wisdom. This principle, is
                    knowing that we are abundant. In practical terms one might
                    simply ask themselves what they would do if they really knew
                    they had and will always have plenty of “money” or “whatever
                    the thing.” The ego works in the realm of lack and
                    protection. Freedom knows it has it all; freedom is
                    dis-identified with conditions.{' '}

                  <p>
                    <strong>The Principle of Power</strong>
                    Am I moving with true power or am I seeking power over
                    another? It is pretty much this simple. False Power usually
                    has us seeking Money, Sex, Fame, Power (over another.) True
                    power, I really have trouble defining, but it reminds me of
                    what the most caring, strong, wise King or Queen would do,
                    namely: Serve The People.{' '}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>The Principle of Service</strong>
                    How am I serving the situation and those around me? The
                    Principle Of Service, has a similar effect as the Principle
                    Of Freedom: it will heal you and those around you. Service,
                    basically is a direct expression of Freedom. Am I free, and
                    being of service or not? Again, we are not saying that
                    service looks a certain way or trying to create a dogmatic
                    view of service. Ryan, in Episode Seven, would have served
                    his own and Elle’s evolution, if he had stood up and said
                    something to her rather than quietly avoiding “rocking the
                    boat.” He chose comfort and fear of “hurting others,” rather
                    than of stepping into personal power and being of service.

                    would over think what to do or how to handle a situation.
                    But I have found that if I look to principles for guidance,
                    the action is usually very, very clear. It doesn’t mean it
                    is an easy choice or easy action to take, because the ego
                    and conditioning might be screaming at you to do the
                    reverse. So, it takes courage! But ultimately principles
                    take a lot of guesswork out of life and start to really
                    develop your muscle of faith… and we start trusting in the
                    universe and our expanded self more… we create an aptitude
                    for jumping into that mystery… into the GAP of Chapter Five…
                    we invite the unknown, we feel abundant and courageous… and
                    we begin to live more in Freedom.

                      Coming to principles on our own: your own experience.
                    </strong>
                    In Episode 9, I think you can clearly see that Jeff is
                    starting to understand the principles. But to me its still
                    feels like the real test will be when he gets home with his
                    family. There he will apply the principles in daily life and
                    have the experience. At that point some other language or
                    other way to explain his principles may occur. It might not
                    be called living in service to him, but he might think “ ok,
                    what would help me grow up and be a living example for my
                    kids.” We’ll speak more about our characters in the
                    character section. For now, lets summarize what we’ve
                    learned about principles.{' '}

                    When we watch stories on television, we empathize with
                    characters. We feel scared with them, we hope for redemption
                    for them, we cheer for them, and something about them
                    resonates with us. Hopefully what resonates are their
                    virtues and strengths. Here is a reminder of the six major
                    virtues and their sub virtues.

                  <p> COURAGE: Perseverance, Bravery </p>
                  <p>TEMPERANCE: Spirituality.</p>
                  <p>
                    Years ago, Ryan had a bad construction accident. It led to
                    intermittent seizures. Then one day he had a seizure while
                    riding his motorcycle and it banged him up into many broken
                    bones. He vowed not to ride again. But with the
                    encouragement of his wife he got back on the bike. He
                    transcended those initial fears. And only a couple months
                    before this trip, was he finally medically cleared to ride.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In Episode 1 of the series, Ryan is riding home at night and
                    is blinded by all the trucks. Eventually he stops and pulls
                    over, especially as his own headlight was out. Then in
                    Episode 2, we leave Rishikesh and en route to Kedarnath he
                    can’t find his seizure medication. Again, nighttime sets in
                    and this time it's monsoon rains and lightning. Now, here in
                    Episode 9, after the longest single day ride, Ryan finds
                    himself again at night blinded by lights. He doesn’t realize
                    that the whole group, other than Anand, has stopped due to
                    the darkness and treacherous roads. But he{' '}
                    <strong>Perseveres, Transcends</strong> his fears again, and
                    makes it to Rishikesh. I think its also really important to
                    note that the passenger on his bike, Anna, was telling him
                    she <strong>Trusts</strong> him, to take it slow, and that
                    everything is ok. Her trust rubbed off on him, no doubt.
                    That is the power of community, of a Sangha (spiritual
                    community.)

                  <p> TRANSCENDENCE: Appreciation, Gratitude.</p>
                  <p>
                    As I mentioned above, Jeff is starting to understand the
                    principles. But to me its still feels like the real test
                    will be when he gets home with his family. That said, he is
                    recognizing that he needs to be a leader at home. He is
                    recognizing that he needs to love and{' '}
                    <strong>Appreciate</strong> his family and thus serve them.
                    Serving them, as we know, is not always making them feel
                    better, nor is it staying quiet to avoid conflict. In fact,
                    Jen mentioned earlier in the series that she felt Jeff
                    needed to step in and help discipline the kids more… perhaps
                    not always be the “liked” dad. So, it looks like Jeff is
                    realizing that he needs to <strong>Lead</strong> this{' '}
                    <strong>Team</strong> from a place of love and service and
                    not from a place of himself feeling comfortable. He needs to
                    drop the comfort that the ego seeks and step up to be the
                    man.

                  <p>
                    HUMANITY: Love, Kindness, Social Intelligence JUSTICE:
                    Teamwork
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    First of all, we hear about Mark through the eyes of both
                    Ryan and Fred. Ryan tells us that this big hulk of a guy is
                    really as kind and sweet as can be. I can attest to that as
                    well. He is a true friend and will always be there for you
                    and the team. Fred also expresses how grateful he was to
                    have his support up at the lake. Mark basically convinced
                    Fred to go in the lake with him. Mark was holding him and
                    told him how proud he was of him for going in. Community
                    support, <strong>Teamwork,</strong> is important to Fred and
                    Mark has been a rock for Fred throughout the trip. Mark
                    truly shows his <strong>Love, Kindness</strong> and through
                    his <strong>Social Intelligence</strong> really knew that
                    Fred just needed a nudge to get in that water.

                    DHARMA WISDOM TALK by HIMALAYAN MASTER ANAND MEHROTRA
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                    In the bonus footage talk, we are at a bridge in Rishikesh.
                    We are brought back to one of the initial teachings in the
                    series, which is that of how our stories bind us. It is
                    fitting that we dive deeper into that now having returned
                    and rewritten many of the beliefs we’ve had about ourselves.
                    Still, stories will creep back in from the past and new ones
                    will be created. This is the nature of stories and of the
                    ego. As Anand says, “I see 5,000 stories every day. So many
                    reasons for people to stay stuck.” With our new found wisdom
                    we can be ever more alert to and aware of the programs that
                    would normally run us. Much like in my example at the
                    beginning of this chapter, Anand reminds us of the pitfalls
                    of escape and blame. Now, with principles on our side we can
                    lean more deeply into freedom.{' '}

                    MEDITATION/MANTRA: COMPASSION FOR SELF AND ALL.
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                    In many of the motorcycle journeys, especially The Highest
                    Pass, we went into areas of India that are very influenced
                    by Tibet. In Ladakh India, where the actual Highest Pass is,
                    it is mostly a Tibetan Vajrayan tradition. This is known as
                    the thunderbolt tradition. It is very appropriate for
                    pilgrimage because this tradition seeks to bring up and use
                    the very human experiences, emotions, and desires. This is
                    where you see the masks and loud horns and symbols crashing
                    and such. So there is this real fierceness and courageous
                    meeting of life head on, not repressing it or denying it.
                    Yet if you’ve heard the Dalai Lama you know that its also
                    incredibly compassionate. You see, when you know all these
                    same things exist in us all and that we all truly want
                    freedom and liberation, there is a sense of compassion that
                    sets in. We know that ignorance is just a passing state in
                    us and in others.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So in this meditation we are again going to get grounded and
                    then expand our awareness to include other beings, family,
                    animals, the earth etc… And once there we will extend the
                    very best of ourselves to them. We call on that part of us
                    that is living in Freedom, that is the principled nature of
                    ourselves, and share it with others. In Sanskrit, its Om
                    Mane Padme Hum. May the sacred jewel of my heart shine forth
                    and bring light and happiness to all beings. This mantra
                    sets us and those around us free (if they chose to be), or
                    at least frees us from our resentments and wrong perceptions
                    of them.{' '}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The pranayama we will begin with is breath of light, which
                    very quickly lightens us up. Then Sukha Shunya eight-part
                    alternating breath, which will really change the mental
                    patterns. That stops us in our tracks as we are guided on a
                    visualization to include all beings, the land, the earth,
                    the galaxy and beyond. It is there that we bring in the
                    sacred mantra.{' '}

                    Move the way love makes you move. Fear only leads to
                    violence and escape. It does not lead to Life. Fear seeks
                    escape from life.
