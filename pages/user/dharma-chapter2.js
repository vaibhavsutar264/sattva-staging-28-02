                  <p>
                    In this chapter, we learn that the stories we have can keep
                    us stuck. These are stories of our abilities and the stories
                    we have of what’s possible. The stories keep us from
                    embracing the freedom we deserve and the stories create
                    endless justifications for not living in freedom. In this
                    chapter we learn to go beyond these stories, so much so that
                    we can call in a sense of calm and freedom before the outer
                    world is telling us we can be. In essence, we can be free
                    now and not need to wait until the outer world nor our inner
                    stories prove that we can be.{' '}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    During the Puja ceremony in this episode we are reminded
                    that Anand himself had a prophecy that he would die in an
                    accident in his late twenties. So he has faced this story,
                    and this fear, head on for all of his life. We see Jen and
                    Jeff’s dream is to save their marriage on this journey, but
                    it’s clear they are in different mindsets from the
                    beginning. And we see Fred struggling more and more while
                    other riders’ accidents make it clear that the passengers
                    are at as much risk as anyone.

                    So, we jump on the motorcycles, leave the safety of
                    Rishikesh, and head into the heart of the torrential
                    monsoons; monsoon rains and the monsoon of the mind’s
                    stories.{' '}

                    CHAPTER TWO: FREEDOM FROM STORIES
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                    I’ll start by relating an experience in my life when the
                    circumstances of life were not so “good.” It was a time when
                    it would have been easy to justify the story that I was not
                    “good enough to be happy.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I was broke and in debt, something I said I would never be.
                    I just had broken up with my girlfriend and now had no place
                    to live. I had just torn my meniscus, a knee injury that
                    would need surgery. So it felt like I had no money, no
                    woman, no home, no mobility… and no prospects for work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It would have been easy to feel sorry for myself, right? Or
                    that I was failing? It would have been easy to not be happy,
                    I think we can agree on that. And it would have been really
                    easy to think that once I get those things, then it will all
                    be better. It’s an easy recipe for believing that the
                    stories of ourselves are what define us.{' '}
                  </p>

                    <div class='col-xl-10 col-lg-10'>
                      <p>
                        It’s best if we can establish a practice now, and not
                        wait until things are in crisis. Because then when
                        crisis hits, we have the practice, rather than using the
                        practice to fix life.

                  <p>
                    Thankfully I had been on this path for many years, studying
                    with my guru for years as well. So, I made my mind up to use
                    this time in my life to establish a love, happiness, and
                    appreciation of my self worth, regardless of how things were
                    “going.” I knew that this was the time to really practice. I
                    mean, should I really not be happy just because I am in debt
                    right now? This doesn’t mean I’m not working on getting
                    projects, or money, or a home or doing physical therapy. Of
                    course I am doing that. But I am not going to wait until
                    everything is better to start being happy, or to start being
                    at peace, or to love myself. In essence I chose that this
                    time in my life was my pilgrimage. I chose that I would use
                    it to learn to give worth to what/who I really am. I chose
                    to NOT buy into the story that the ego and society was
                    telling me. And I chose to jump to a place of calm, peace
                    and happiness… NOW.{' '}

                    Elle and Fred are really being asked, by Anand, to call in a
                    calm that exists beyond their stories. Elle had just crashed
                    into the mountain due to fear of being hit by another
                    motorcycle. Fred was falling and struggling to ride with any
                    real velocity. So Anand pulls them aside and asks them to
                    call in the calm state now, before they have all the skills
                    of a motorcycle rider. He is very clear that the most
                    important question is if you can be CALM. It is more
                    important than the skills of biking and it is more important
                    than any “Ra Ra Ra, I can do this!” motivational type of
                    thing. He is asking them to transcend the stories that keep
                    them stuck in fear. Elle could say she hasn’t been on gravel
                    before, nor has she witnessed bikes coming at her like that.
                    Sure. True. But it is also a good story to justify fear,
                    instead of jumping into calm. These stories are all too
                    familiar to Anand. He hears them every day from students. So
                    many reasons to stay stuck, in conflict, in their bubbles.{' '}

                    In episode one, a lot was being set up in terms of the
                    riders, the actual adventure and the monsoon rain
                    challenges. The call of a pilgrimage is to burst the bubble,
                    to follow the “aha” moment. Now, in episode two, it is being
                    clearly laid out that the major element of journey is the
                    constant inner practice.

                      Realizing we have these stories is a key to unlocking
                      their bind on our freedom. Seeing our stories, is part of
                      the inner game.
                    </strong>{' '}
                    It is very important to realize that we get caught in
                    stories and in archetypal patterns. This could be something
                    like the “Savior” archetype. In this case one might always
                    be seeking validation of self by saving others. And as we
                    will see in Chapter 7, this pattern/archetype can be a
                    cunning device for keeping us from stepping into our power.
                    How? It might sound “nice” or like you are being a “good
                    person” when you save someone. But you can easily use this
                    as a justification for not standing up for what’s right and
                    true. “I don’t want to hurt someone’s feelings…” can sound
                    nice, but is it really that different from “I’ve never
                    ridden on gravel before?” Both statements can easily be
                    accepted as true, but they can also be cunning stories that
                    keep us from taking responsibility and stepping into greater
                    power and freedom. As I said, we’ll dive more into this in
                    later chapters. The key is to realize when a story or an
                    archetype is keeping us stuck, when it is keeping us from
                    leaping forward and bursting our bubble.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I also want to be super clear that Anand isn’t saying to
                    take this on as an affirmation. This is real experiential
                    practice. We are constantly being asked, when on
                    motorcycles, to remain calm amidst life and death
                    circumstances. It can’t be me saying to myself “I’m calm,”
                    while I’m really freaking out. No. We need to learn how to
                    bring in the calm, to bring in the love, the courage, before
                    the world tells us we are safe. If you cannot be calm, pull
                    over.{' '}

                    There are ways to kind of “hack” the stories. Aside from the
                    meditation I give us at the end of the chapter, and from
                    one’s deep practice of meditation, there are ways to help
                    shift our perspective and remember who we really are. In
                    chapter three we will talk about Shiva, his timeless nature,
                    and a mantra to help transcend time. Here, in the spirit of
                    Shiva and transcending time, I want to relate that we can
                    call on the part of us that is already calm in the future.
                    We can call on the future part of us that already knows how
                    to ride and already knows how to be calm.

                    We have to break free from the linear thinking in order to
                    do this. We can call on the part of us that is already atop
                    the mountain. And I, in my example above, can call upon the
                    man that already knows he is fine, has recovered from
                    surgery, and has a place to live. He says to me “Yes, you
                    can be happy and at ease now. Of course.” In fact, sometimes
                    I ask for the perspective of the “me” who is 95 years old
                    living in the Himalayas. I ask that future me what he thinks
                    of the situation and if I need to freak out. More than
                    usual, he smiles, and says its all fine.{' '}

                  <p>
                    When we call in the new, when we are present, when we pop
                    bubble, we will naturally burn through old stories. It’s a
                    natural affect. So, I am one to say that sometimes we do not
                    need to trudge through the sub consciousness and know all
                    the details of the old stories… I am one to say that as we
                    call in the new and make the leap, the burning of story
                    occurs naturally.{' '}

                    Yes, sometimes we must go in and burn and bring up the
                    demons, yes. Chapter 3 is all about it in fact. We do these
                    journeys to bring up demons, patterns, and archetypes that
                    we weren’t aware of. Of course this is key, to go look and
                    burn. And sometimes we must simply leap and then watch the
                    wake behind us, which are the ego and its stories going up
                    in smoke!

                    the Puja ceremony the night before we leave Rishikesh for
                    the Himalayas. In doing this we are really asking ourselves
                    to surrender the ego, to surrender the stories. We are
                    asking ourselves to be humble. And we are asking ourselves
                    to set intentions from this place of higher being. Otherwise
                    setting intentions, if based in ego, is more like “I want

                    Keep looking for the crack in the story. When the crack
                    happens, then the light comes in… This is the discontinuity

                    in the story is needed for our evolution. What can break the
                    story and create a crack? Taking pilgrimage. A yoga class.
                    Meditation. Laughter. It could just come, but the mind
                    doesn’t like it and starts to interfere. Do Something
                    different! Take an opposite action to the story of the mind.
                    If the story is of lack, you see the fear, the lack story,
                    then take an action of generosity – go give more than you
                    think you can. This cracks the story, the ego hold.{' '}

                    There is often this story of competition with self. There is
                    often the need to prove self to other. There is often the
                    need to seek approval. But realize that these are just
                    stories. As is the story that somehow the world is against
                    us. Realize that there is simply no power in these stories.
                    So why keep them? The key on pilgrimages of great stakes
                    like The Road to Dharma (and your life!) is to realize that
                    the universe is working for me, for you. Embracing that
                    thought and that feeling can actually stop a story from
                    spinning you out. So when a circumstance arises, perhaps we

                    This is why we use the dancer metaphor in Episode 2. The
                    dancer is the dance. You can go look at a piece of art on
                    the wall and the artist doesn’t have to be in that space.
                    But to watch a dance, you must have the dancer present. The
                    dancer is the dance. And we are the path, we are the road to
                    the dharma, and we are the dharma itself. It’s not something
                    we hang on the wall or an accomplishment. And thus you
                    cannot separate the universe from you, it is part of the you
                    that is dancing, so your relationship to it, is your
                    expression of life. You can be in battle with it, you can
                    see it against you, or you can see it working for you, be in
                    love with the universe. The dance is the dancer.

                      I want to take some time to dive into the reasons we went
                      into great detail on these two relationships in this
                      episode.
                    </strong>{' '}
                    Firstly, Jeff and Jen’s journey is a through-line that goes
                    throughout the series, so it is important to understand
                    where they are starting from and track how they change. Jen
                    recently stopped drinking. So the numbing was keeping her
                    from even seeing her stories. But once she stopped and
                    started meditation/yoga, she realized she wasn’t happy.{' '}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now, how much of that unhappiness is a story? Well, that
                    gets unraveled as we go. But it is a starting point and is
                    important for her to know that she and Jeff can’t be
                    together the old way anymore. It is pretty easy to see that
                    their communication is not great, that there is resentment,
                    and both of them need a lot of surrender before any
                    connection can be reignited.{' '}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>
                      I then specifically highlighted Kim and Ryan’s
                      relationship in this episode to show the example of a
                      marriage that is farther along.
                    </strong>{' '}
                    Kim is interested in giving Ryan the space to find his own
                    power, his own self. She lets him do this trip alone, even
                    though she would like to go, because it is what he needs.
                    It’s less about whether this is good for them and more about
                    how it’s good for Ryan. In many ways she feels secure in who
                    she is, who Ryan is, and their relationship. There is a lot
                    of trust there. In Chapter Six we dive deeply into the real
                    trust that is needed for relationships to develop. Trust me,
                    Anand doesn’t mince words in Episode 6, and its not an easy
                    thing for Jeff and Jen to stomach.

                    A huge part of why Kim and Ryan are successful in
                    relationship is that Kim shows a gratitude for Ryan in
                    general. She has an Appreciation for his path in life that
                    extends beyond the confines of their relationship. And she
                    is supporting that. That is love, that is appreciation, and
                    that is also Social Intelligence. The Kindness is shown in
                    her willingness to show up here at the beginning of the trip
                    and help out not only Ryan, but the female passengers too.
                    Sometimes it’s nice to get some tips from a female friend.{' '}

                      Relationship is also a good metaphor for the passengers
                      riding on the back, because they have to surrender and

                    In essence they have to drop the ego and get really{' '}

                    dear life and stressing the rider out. And that might lead

                    In this audio meditation I’ll guide us through a pranayama
                    and visualization to bring light into our being. When full
                    of light, the ego has less hold, in essence we have cracked
                    its tight grasp. We will begin with Nadi Shodhana alternate
                    nostril breathing, then bring in the Breath of Light. Then
                    when here we will further rewire the brain with a mantra
                    that we are light.{' '}

                  <p>
                    As you say this mantra, you will really want to allow
                    yourself to be filled with light. You do not need to force
                    it or make the visual happen. Simply allow. Allow yourself
                    to fill with light. It may look or feel however it does. The
                    key is allowing the light in through that crack. Enjoy.
