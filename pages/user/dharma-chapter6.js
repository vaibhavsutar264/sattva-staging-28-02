                    Without trust there is no love, only insecurity. This isn’t
                    trust in the other person… It’s trust that you are capable

                  <p>
                    We come to these majestic sites to tap into the heritage of
                    spirituality. Yet to receive their great wisdom, we must
                    come humbly, empty, and be ready to listen. But all too
                    often complacency, fear, and self-righteousness set back in…
                    we have great insights and then forget to use them or we
                    being to think we “know it all.” We’ll look at why this
                    happens and how to sustain our quest for freedom. All great
                    masters know that the practice is ongoing, that ones freedom
                    depends on continual transcendence. This is the sustaining
                    principle found at Badrinath.{' '}
                  </p>
                  <p class='mb-0'>
                    In Episode 6, we mirror this idea of sustenance with the
                    relationship of Jeff and Jen, and their ongoing battle of
                    past resentment butting up with current insights and
                    awakening. As you have experienced, relationships often
                    plateau and become “comfortable.” Ironically we forget that
                    in relationships we need to continually relate and we forget
                    that we can use relationships to evolve instead of the get
                    something or somewhere. We forget to humbly listen. These
                    are lofty principles, but what did you expect on a journey
                    for freedom? We come to set ourselves free, and only the
                    truth will do so!

                    This personal experience is a bit longer than usual. Stay
                    with me, ok. We are capable of transcending my long-winded
                    stories.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    About five years ago, I was teaching yoga. I started the
                    class by checking in and asking how people were and if
                    anyone had something going on or needing to talk about. This
                    was a class of 30-40 people, but I always made a concerted
                    effort to build intimacy by creating dialogue and a space to
                    be heard. On this day a lady near the front of class spoke
                    up. She had just found out her husband had been cheating on
                    her, that she would be getting a divorce, leaving him, and
                    yeah, all the anger and fear and emotions that were coming
                    with that.{' '}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Wow that was brave of her, I thought, as I looked at her. I
                    paused, let it sink it for both the class and myself, then
                    said, “Ok. Thank you. Well, today we are going to practice.
                    We are going to work with this... (Still looking at her)
                    And, um, obviously I don’t have the words to make this feel
                    any better or solve it, but we are going to practice. These
                    classes, the poses, the breath, the words I say… are not
                    here to make us feel better. We are practicing WITH this
                    feeling, this emotion. We are going to practice, to allow
                    ourselves to feel all of this too, ok?” (Remember Episode
                    Three we talk of awareness, allowing, and transcending). I
                    continued to speak to the class “To cry if we want to cry.
                    To feel it all. To allow it all. We aren’t trying to solve
                    this, or feel better. Now, with this intense situation
                    happening and feeling, we still show up and practice. I so
                    appreciate you coming, and sharing…. So, let’s become aware.
                    Let’s Allow. Let’s Feel. Practice. And we’ll see what
                    comes.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This example reminds us (like in Chapter Five) that we must
                    be with things first, that in order to understand we must
                    first fall into love (into faith and into the mystery). Fall
                    in love first and then the understanding will rise from the
                    falling into love, not the other way around. So we are
                    allowing ourselves to experience whatever happens, without
                    trying to escape the experience. That is love. Understanding
                    comes from that place. Usually we want to understand and
                    solve, so as to avoid feeling it, to avoid having to fall in
                    love (which is unknown.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So this example builds on some wisdom from Chapter Five (and
                    Four) and now launches us into Chapter Six. Here, in this
                    chapter, we need to continually trust our ability to
                    transcend. We need to remain humble, to practice, to
                    receive. We need to watch out for the self-righteous
                    thinking that we know it all, or have the answers. We need
                    to even watch out for the desire to know it all too.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Personally I could feel the tendency and desire to want to
                    solve or fix or have the answer for the woman in the yoga
                    class, especially in front of a class that I am “teaching.”
                    But, I knew we needed to trust, to open up more so we could
                    receive. The class and the practice would help. So I was
                    going practice the same thing I am asking her to practice.
                    Allow, Feel and Trust. Then Listen and Receive. We’ll see
                    what wisdom comes through….{' '}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For the rest of the people in the class, I can imagine that
                    they could no longer hold on to that thought of “yeah, I
                    went to yoga today, got my workout in.” We were practicing
                    more deeply now, together. And thankfully we were in a yoga
                    studio, and had created a place where this receiving felt
                    safe. The place reverberated with some awareness… in some
                    ways was a sacred place to allow for that deep practice. So,
                    you don’t have to go to the Himalayas, but thankfully in The
                    Road To Dharma we are arriving at our third sacred peak,
                    Badrinath. Here, we have a great opportunity to continue to
                    practice on our motorcycle journey, to be in a place
                    reverberating with so much wisdom…{' '}

                    In Chapter Two we spoke of how many stories we have. Anand
                    likened it to a radio station full of thousands of stories
                    that we can easily tune into. He says he hears like 5000
                    stories a day from people, that the mind has oh so many
                    stories.

                      The good news is that instead of tuning into our past

                    A place like Badrinath has been meditated in for centuries
                    upon centuries. The yogis have come here to gather and look
                    deeply into the truth of their being. And specifically at
                    Badrinath, many yogis have come and literally hibernated all
                    winter. The tales are of yogis that would seal themselves in
                    metal boxes for the winter and go into deep states of
                    meditation for months on end. Of course, we are not asking
                    anyone to do that or saying it’s necessary. But as a viewer
                    and reader, I want you to realize that this place has been
                    vibrating with those experiences for an incredibly long
                    time. And if you are tuned in, you can feel it. What’s tuned
                    in? We’ll get to that. For now become aware that The
                    Himalayas in general are, as Anand says, “The spiritual
                    heritage of Humanity.”

                    called Vishnu, and who is known as the preserver of the
                    dharma. I love that term, “The preserver of the dharma.” It
                    feels to me like we are talking about “the guardian of the
                    galaxy…” and in many ways that is the truth. This preserving
                    of the dharma inside of you is like fighting to save the
                    good in the galaxy. It’s the ongoing battle to stay tuned in
                    and receptive amidst the pushes and pulls of the mind… of

                    transcendence? As we get to the plateaus in life, we might
                    start thinking we know it all or have figured it out. In
                    essence we start creating a new story around who we are now.
                    “I’m a yoga teacher who has been to India, I know.” This can
                    keep us from listening, can keep us from receiving, can keep
                    us from tuning in and thus keep us from growth, evolution
                    and freedom. To be free - is to constantly evolve.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So first, we must get empty. Now, I am not a purist who
                    believes we need to be totally empty of all thoughts,
                    feelings, attachments, ego, etc… We don’t need to be in
                    nirvana and empty of it all!?! The lady in the yoga studio
                    going through divorce was not empty of a real experience of
                    life. But what was she empty of? She was empty of arrogance.
                    Empty of thinking she knew it all. In fact she was quite
                    humbled, which can be a great place to learn from.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Being empty of fear is key too, but let’s not be too
                    dogmatic on this either. The lady in the yoga studio wasn’t
                    really empty of fear. On one level she was feeling lots of
                    fear. On another level she was also not afraid to share, not
                    afraid to open the door. And now as we practiced in class
                    we/she became more apt to allow the feelings, to allow the
                    thoughts, to soften around them rather than fight them or
                    guard herself from them… so she truly (in actual practice,
                    not a concept) wasn’t afraid of the feelings…. And thus she
                    was more open to receive the possibility of more wisdom.

                    Perhaps we can read a couple of Anand’s quotes with more
                    clarity now.

                        To tune in, we must be empty of fear. Not agree or
                        disagree, not like or dislike, we must drop all
                        judgment.

                    Some might think these journeys are religious in nature, but
                    they are not. Religions, historically, tend to delineate and
                    separate and create divisions. The teachings of the
                    religions are beautiful, but the religions around it tend to
                    create the divisions and identifications that separate you
                    from me. Jew from Christian from Muslim and so on.

                        We might begin with belief. But somewhere that belief
                        ends and knowing begins. When belief ends and knowing
                        begins, that’s spirituality. An expansive evolutionary
                        knowingness. That knowing is not the end. It’s always
                        learning, fluid and humble. It’s always inclusive. It
                        includes everything. Any teaching or idea that is
                        exclusive, is originating from a state of ignorance.

                    So, drop the idea that we have it all figured out.
                    <br /> Get humble.
                    <br /> Empty yourself from feelings of separation and from
                    being guarded.
                    <br /> We all are human, so let yourself feel life.
                    <br /> And now we can start to listen.
                    <br /> Now we can tune in and receive. <br /> Tune in to
                    what? <br /> Tune into the vibration and frequency of a
                    place or of a teaching. <br /> Receive what? The wisdom, the
                    truth, the perspective… you’ll see…

                    somewhere more supportive of evolution. Perhaps go to a
                    place of power or around other people of great wisdom and
                    power that will support your evolution. For the lady in
                    divorce, she came to the studio to tune in. She came. She
                    was humble, real, and allowed her self to feel and listen…

                    Later in this chapter, we will use Jeff and Jen’s
                    relationship as a great example of this ongoing sustenance
                    of transcendence. You can imagine how often we get
                    complacent in relationships. How often we get afraid in
                    relationship. Get self righteous in our ideas and forget to
                    be humble, to listen or to receive. Sound familiar?

                    Notice Anand is not asking us to trust in another person.
                    Trust is normally defined as a belief in the reliability,
                    ability, and truth of another person or thing. But notice
                    that this definition is putting trust in something outside
                    of ourselves. Does this make sense? Now, are we allowed to
                    trust people and we trust everyday things to work well? Yes
                    of course. But, we don’t need to fully give our power to the
                    other, to put our trust in them. What I mean is that we
                    don’t need to put the responsibility for our experience of
                    life onto them. We should be wary of trusting that the other
                    person will save us. In my yoga-teaching example, I was
                    surely not going to save that woman. I will simply show her
                    the skills she can build in her self. I will remind her that
                    she is capable. And this is what Anand does for us on the
                    motorcycle journey. Remember in Episode 4 he even says, in
                    relation to the sleeping bag issue: “Did I ask you to trust
                    me? No, I did not. That was your choice.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>The responsibility is on us.</strong> <br />
                    We must trust that we can transcend anything. Nobody will do
                    it for us. And in any relationship, we are not going to wait
                    to feel unafraid/safe… This is key! We are not going to wait
                    for the perfect person we can trust to feel unafraid, nor
                    for the person to make us feel safe! Just like in Chapter
                    Two, Anand asks Elle to call on CALM now, before she knows
                    how to ride - we too can call on that feeling of “safety”
                    now before there is an outer experience of another person
                    who makes us feel safe. We call on trust now. We bring in
                    the knowing that we can transcend anything… bring it in now.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>
                      And then realize that in this way trust begets love.
                    </strong>{' '}
                    <br />
                    Without this trust. Without this faith. Without stepping
                    into trusting ourselves, we constantly seek it in others.
                    And thus our “love” is really an expression of insecurity.
                    So true love, starts with true trust in oneself. Trust is
                    love. The moment you trust, you actually start filling
                    yourself more and more with love. It’s strange like that.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I can’t believe that actually makes sense… if you understand
                    it, congrats! I’m still working on practicing it all the
                    time.

                        Often we are afraid to be found out. We keep the façade
                        up. Then the moment someone threatens the façade, we
                        judge them. We get together and try to pull them down.

                  <p>
                    The bonus footage goes really deep into relationships. It is
                    a brutally honest discussion that is not so easy to hear,
                    but super necessary. Anand likes to say that relationships
                    are like “Ships,” people get on them to try to get
                    somewhere. Then, when it doesn’t take you where you want to
                    go, you get angry. So it becomes about the ship instead of
                    the relating. In essence, we forget to relate because we
                    just wanted to get somewhere.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The other main idea is that we really must become whole and
                    that we really must find the trust in ourselves that we just
                    spoke about. Trust ourselves, not other.

                        When we are fragmented, and get in a relationship, then
                        for sometime our attention goes elsewhere (on the other)
                        and we feel ok. Then when the relationship becomes part
                        of the norm, the attention shifts back on ourselves and
                        we realize we are still fragmented. And then we blame
                        the other…

                    In Episode 6, we start by Jeff wondering if he even really
                    knows what relationship is or is confident in his ability to
                    be in one. At least he is looking. That’s humble. Then later
                    he again owns the fact that he has gotten comfortable,
                    doesn’t listen, doesn’t relate to Jen or take her out
                    anymore. This is good. Then near the end of the episode, we
                    are ready to ask if they are willing to use the relationship
                    to evolve and to be free…

                  <p>
                    The key for relating or for relationship is to evolve. How
                    can I evolve? How can I serve your evolution? How can we
                    expand and set each other free. Trust will support our
                    evolution - not blame.

                        certain feeling. As we get subtler, we can feel this and

                    Transcending is very similar to Tuning In, as it supports
                    our practice.

                    When we watch stories on television, we empathize with
                    characters. We feel scared with them, we hope for redemption
                    for them, we cheer for them, and something about them
                    resonates with us. Hopefully what resonates are their
                    virtues and strengths. Here is a reminder of the six major
                    virtues and their sub virtues.

                    These are also qualities to reinforce and that give us

                    I feel like we are starting to see a different Mario here at
                    the beginning of Episode Six. While riding to Badrinath he
                    takes a fall, smacks his head on a rock, and slices his
                    hand. Thankfully he was wearing his helmet, which shows a
                    growing <strong>Prudence</strong> and respect for these
                    roads. He is also super grateful he was wearing his helmet.
                    I think it really put him into a state of{' '}
                    <strong>Gratitude</strong>, knowing he could have been
                    seriously hurt. The macho facade is let down and he asks us
                    if his passenger Aizhan can ride in the car with us. He has
                    been <strong>Humbled</strong> and knows he needs to slow
                    down, stay receptive and aware while riding. He is again
                    very respectful of the road and of another’s life. So even
                    though it’s a hit to his ego to ask the passenger to be in
                    the car, it is the fair thing to do. It shows{' '}

                    Hearing Jeff while we are in Badrinath is also quite a
                    shift. I mean, last episode he was dancing around without a
                    helmet, still his young boy self. Now, he’s questioning if
                    he even understands relationship or has ever been committed.
                    There is a Humility here from Jeff. He also is realizing how
                    complacent he has been in their relationship. He hasn’t
                    tried to relate! And he surely has put all of that
                    responsibility on Jen. He is starting to wake up to realize
                    that he needs to be participating here. He needs to make
                    choices. He needs to serve and take steps to care for Jen,
                    the relationship, and their evolution. That’s a form of
                    Appreciation. I feel like within that realization, he is
                    starting to forgive her and let some of his resentment of
                    her go. It shows in this clip at Badrinath.{' '}

                    fierce feminine evolution right to this man. He can either
                    step up or step out. I love this episode.

                    DHARMA WISDOM TALK by HIMALAYAN MASTER ANAND MEHROTRA{' '}
                  </h5>

                  <p>
                    In the bonus footage, Anand speaks deeply about
                    relationships, really explaining the wisdom breakdown we’ve
                    touched on so far. This talk takes place a few kilometers
                    past Bardrinath at a town called Mana. It is the end of the
                    road. From here onward it’s simply a walking path into miles
                    upon miles of pure Himalayan peaks… eventually arriving in
                    Tibet. It is quite a place to speak of the transcendent work
                    we must do on our own. It reminds us of the vigilant
                    practice needed in a very beautiful yet unforgivingly fierce
                    environment. Yogis would come meditate/hibernate here all
                    winter.

                    Enjoy the talk from Anand, with the mighty Himalayas pouring
                    down in the background. In it you’ll find:

                    MEDITATION/MANTRA: SIMPLE SUSTAINANCE. CULTIVATING HUMBLE
                    RECEPTIVITY{' '}
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                    Being receptive will help us relate to the world and each
                    other. So, we can meditate to cultivate a sense of humble
                    receptivity. And doing so is really a practice of the
                    basics. Like a pro athlete knows, a sport is executing the
                    simple skills, but doing so under high pressure and at high
                    speeds.{' '}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We’ll begin the meditation with the Breath of Nectar, also
                    called the Amrita Breath. This really slows us down and
                    connects us to the Prana, the energy. Then we balance the
                    male and female energy with Alom Vilom. And then we bring in
                    a mantra Aham Shraddha, which means both “I am devotion” and
                    “I am faith.” I prefer the latter, as it resonates with me.
                    It’s not “having” faith or holding a “belief,” it is that I
                    am faith. Every moment I am here and not running off in
                    support of or believing the story of the ego, then I am
                    faith. It is simple, but when the pressure is on, that’s
                    where the hours of practice and years of practice and
                    embodying this notion can get tested. So, lets practice and
                    cultivate our ability to sustain.{' '}

                    Without trust there is no love, only insecurity. This isn’t
                    trust in the other person… It’s trust that you are capable
                    of transcending, no matter what is.
